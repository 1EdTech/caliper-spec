## Introduction

### What is this document?

This document is an informative part of the
[Caliper Analytics <sup>&copy;</sup> 1.2 document set](https://www.imsglobal.org/example/v1p1/#document-set).
As such, it may be revised without the specification version being incremented.
Please refer to the [revision history](#revision-history) below for more information
about revisions to this document.

As an informative resource it does not include any normative requirements. Occurrences in this document of terms such as MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD or RECOMMENDED have no impact on the conformance criteria for implementors of this specification.

The primary goal of this document is to lead you to successful implementation of the Caliper Analytics&reg; v1.2 specification. More than that, this guide helps you along the way to achieving conformance certification.

### How to use this document

This document is intended as a starting point for those looking to implement the Caliper Analytics&reg; standard in their educational software ecosystem.

This guide can be used to get a fundamental understanding of the Caliper messaging structure, review specific code examples of Caliper events, and as a central hub containing links to conformance requirements and other important resources. The document can also be used as a reference for collated best practices on how to use Caliper in their digital ecosystem and guidance on using Caliper in collaboration with other IMS specifications.

This document is also meant to assist the reader in learning how to use the main Caliper specification to look up specific items during implementation.

## Terminology

Learning this vocabulary in the context of the Caliper specification will be very helpful when using this document.  Caliper Analytics describes events using [_triples_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple), a semantic structure that consists of the combination of an **action** being undertaken by an **actor** to an **object**.  A good way to think of it as _someone_ (**actor**) did _something_ (**action**) to _someone/something_ (**object**)

Here are a few useful definitions for terms used throughout this document.  Full Caliper terminology list is available in the [Terminology section of the Caliper Spec](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#terminology).

<dl>
  <dt>Action</dt><dd>Part of an Event that describes the <em>what</em> .</dd>

  <dt>Sensor</dt><dd> Software deployed within a learning application that capture and transmit Caliper data to a target endpoint</dd>
</dl>

Here is a short explanation of how Caliper works using this vocabulary. If you can understand this you're well on your way to understanding Caliper!

When a Caliper-observable interaction, as defined by a _Metric Profile_, is detected by a _Sensor_, an _Event_ is created which consists of an _Actor_, an _Object_, and an _Action_. (The Actor did the Action to the Object) To emit an _Event_ to another system via an API call, it is described as a JSON object which is wrapped in an _Envelope_ with a little metadata about the _Sensor_. The JSON is then sent via a secured HTTP call with an authentication token in an HTTP header.

## Conformance Certification

<section id="conformance">
  <h3>Conformance Statements</h3>
</section>

### What is Conformance Certification?
IMS offers a process for testing the conformance of products using the IMS certification test suite. Certification designates passing a set of tests that verify the standard has been implemented correctly and guarantees a productâ€™s interoperability across hundreds of other certified products. The Caliper Analytics [Conformance Certification Guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2/cert) provides details about the testing process, requirements, and how to get started.

### What are the benefits of Conformance Certification?
Conformance certification offers more than claims of "compliance,". The only way IMS can guarantee interoperability is by obtaining certification for the latest version of the standard. Only products listed in the official IMS Certified Product Directory can claim conformance certification. IMS certification provides the assurance that a solution will integrate securely and seamlessly into an institution's digital learning ecosystem.

### How does my product get certified?
Certification for Caliper Analytics involves certifying against one or more Metric Profiles.  This means  passing the appropriate tests for the profile or profiles that you are implementing using  the IMS Global suite of Caliper Analytics certification tools.  For more information on the conformance and certification process, please refer to the The Caliper Analytics [Conformance Certification Guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2/cert).

## What's new in Caliper 1.2?

In addition to improvements and additions to vocabulary throughout the Caliper 1.2 information model, Caliper introduces 6 new metric profiles built based on market need and member feedback.  Please follow the associated links below to learn more about them.  Those profiles are:

- [Feedback Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-feedback)
- [Resource Management Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-resourcemanagement)
- [Search Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-search)
- [Survey Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-survey)
- [Tool Launch Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-toollaunch)

Additionally, the [Tool Use Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-tooluse) has been improved to account for the collection of measures that track student progress via the collection of aggregate measures.

## How to create a Caliper Event

### Events

[Link to full Event documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event)

An Event is the combination of an **Actor**, an **Action**, and an **Object**. In a sentence, an Event describes what an Actor _did_ (Action) to an Object. Each of those will be described in the following sections.

It's important to have a clear understanding of Caliper Events since they describe the semantics of what's happening in the system.


#### Event Types

Caliper Events each specify which type of event they are.  Events of the same type have several things in common, like required and optional properties. Some event types include:

[AnnotationEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AnnotationEvent), [AssignableEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AssignableEvent), [AssessmentEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AssessmentEvent), [AssessmentItemEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AssessmentItemEvent), [ForumEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#ForumEvent), [MediaEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#MediaEvent), [MessageEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#MessageEvent), [NavigationEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#NavigationEvent), [GradeEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#GradeEvent), [SessionEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#SessionEvent), [ToolUseEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#ToolUseEvent), [ThreadEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#ThreadEvent), [ViewEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#ViewEvent)

A full list of event types is available in the Caliper Spec (See "Subtype" subsection of [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event)).

#### Choosing the appropriate Event

To choose the best Event for your situation you can scan the list of event types and see which one seems to match best, or you can also start by looking at a Metric Profile and see what events are described there that might meet your needs already.

If there is no existing Event that meets your needs you can use a "generic" event from the [General Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-general). These events allow any actor, action, and object you need and aren't constrained like the specific events from other profiles. This should provide you with the flexibility you need when your use case isn't already met by existing profiles.

#### Event Required Properties

Each [Event Type](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event) can have different required properties. To review what's required, find the specific event you're creating in the Caliper spec document and review the table there. For example, you can look at the [Annotation Event's](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AnnotationEvent) properties table.

All property tables will look like the following table. This table shows the base Event property requirements that all events share.


| Property | Type | Description | Disposition |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [UUID](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#uuidDef) | A version 4 [UUID](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#uuidDef).  The UUID MUST be expressed as a [URN](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#urnDef) using the form <code>urn:uuid:<UUID></code> per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122). | Required |
| type | [Term](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#termDef) | A string value for the Event Sub Type, or for a generic [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event) set the <code>type</code> to the string value <code>Event</code>. | Required |
| actor | [Agent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#agent) or [IRI](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#iriDef) | The [Agent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#agent) who initiated the [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event).  This must be either:  <ul><li>An [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) of the type Agent or one of its subtypes (e.g., Person, SoftwareApplication, etc.).</li><li>A unique [IRI](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#iriDef) that represents an [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) as described above.  Ideally this should refer to an [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) previously defined in the payload containing the [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event) or in an eventstore that contains the [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event).| Required |
| action | [Term](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#termDef) | The action or predicate that binds the actor or subject to the object.  The <code>action</code> range is limited to the set of [actions](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#actions) described in this specification and may be further constrained by the chosen [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event) type.  Only one <code>action</code> [Term](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#termDef) may be specified per [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event). | Required |
| object | [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) or [IRI](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#iriDef) | The [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) that comprises the object of the interaction.  The <code>object</code> value MUST be expressed either as an object or as a string corresponding to the object's [IRI](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#iriDef). | Required |
| eventTime | DateTime | An ISO 8601 date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates when the [Event](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#event) occurred.  The value MUST be expressed using the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified. | Required |

#### Additional properties on Events

While the base information required by most Events is represented in the above example, each Event type could require more properties, and allow for more properties and context as desired by the implementors. To understand what information is required and possible you should consult each [Event Type's](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event) documentation for the activities you're trying to implement.

#### Entity or IRI
Properties with the type "[Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entity) or [IRI](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#iriDef)" may be represented as a Caliper entity or an IRI [Internationalized Resource Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier) string.  An IRI may be used to refer to an entity that has been defined earlier, either in the same event, in another event in the same payload, or even in another event in the same eventstore.  The IRI may be a URL, but it's not required.  It could be a URN instead, using the "urn" scheme rather than the "http" or "https" schemes commonly used with URLs.  Often, using a blank node scheme (represented by a single underscore character, "\_") offers flexibility to specify an IRI without the burden of requiring it to resolve to a resource like a URL or to follow specific syntax, like a URN.

#### Event JSON stub

This is an example of what an Event's JSON looks like without the actor/action/object. A full example will be given below.

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "ViewEvent",
  "eventTime": "2020-01-15T10:15:00.000Z",
  "actor": {},
  "action": "",
  "object": {}
}
</code></pre>

### Actors

In a Caliper Event, the <code>Actor</code> performs the action related to a learning activity. The value of an Event's actor attribute must be an [Agent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Agent) or one of its subtypes. While often the Actor is a Person, it could also be another Entity type, such as an Organization or SoftwareApplication.

Each Event type further limits what Agents can be used as the value of the actor property; for example, the actor for a [QuestionnaireEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#QuestionnaireEvent) must be a Person, while the actor for a [GradeEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#GradeEvent) could be either a Person or a SoftwareApplication (such as an autograder).

The generic Event allows any Agent declared in the specification.

#### Actor JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
  "type": "Person"
}
</code></pre>

### Action

[Link to full Action documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#actions)

An <code>Action</code> connects an Actor with an Object, helping to describe what learning activity has taken place. Examples include <code>Bookmarked</code>, <code>Launched</code>, <code>OptedIn</code>, and <code>Skipped</code>.

A specific [Event Type](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event) specifies what actions are valid for that type. For example, you can look at the [Annotation Event's](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AnnotationEvent) properties table to see that the Action must be one of: <code>Bookmarked</code>, <code>Highlighted</code>, <code>Shared</code>, or <code>Tagged</code>.

The generic Event allows any Action declared in the specification.

#### Action JSON

<pre><code class="json">
"Viewed"
</code></pre>

### Object

The <code>Object</code> of an Event must be an [Entity](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#entities) or one of its subtypes.

A specific [Event Type](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Event) specifies what types of Entities are valid for that type. For example, you can look at the [Annotation Event's](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AnnotationEvent) properties table to see that the Object must be a [DigitalResource](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#DigitalResource).

The generic Event allows any Entity declared in the specification.

#### Object JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/202001/courses/7/sections/1/readings/1",
  "type": "DigitalResource",
  "name": "Chapter 1 reading"
}
</code></pre>

### Caliper Event JSON Examples

There are many examples of events to help you learn how to construct them. Below is an example combining the above documentation.

Other sources for example Event JSON:

* The main Caliper spec document has many examples for each Event Type. For example see the [AnnotationEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#AnnotationEvent) and scroll past the requirements table to the examples below.
* The public Github repository has many examples for testing purposes: [Caliper 1.2 JSON Examples](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-spec/tree/develop/fixtures/v1p2)
* If you're an IMS member and have access to the [Caliper certification tool](https://caliper.imsglobal.org/sec/index.html), you can access those same examples in the Caliper Playground's "Manual Testing" area.

#### Complete JSON

To bring the above examples together, an Event would look something like this:

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",
  "type": "ViewEvent",
  "eventTime": "2020-01-15T10:16:00.000Z",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Viewed",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/202001/courses/7/sections/1/readings/1",
    "type": "DigitalResource",
    "name": "Chapter 1 reading"
  }
}
</code></pre>

This Event can be read as "This Person Viewed this DigitalResource at this eventTime".

#### Smaller, ID-Only JSON

As explained in the [Entity or IRI](#entity-or-iri) section above, Caliper allows the use just the ID string instead of the whole JSON object if the size of your events needs to be smaller.

This ID-only example is equivalent to the full example above:

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",
  "type": "ForumEvent",
  "eventTime": "2020-01-15T10:16:00.000Z",
  "actor": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
  "action": "Subscribed",
  "object": "https://example.edu/terms/202001/courses/7/sections/1/forums/1"
}
</code></pre>

## Metric Profiles

Each [Caliper Metric Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profiles) is a domain-specific set of terms and concepts to describe common education learning activities. Their purpose is to help ensure users of Caliper have _consistent syntax and semantics_ when describing these events. Some examples of what profiles attempt to describe are Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment submission.

A great way to think of a Metric Profile is **what questions it can help answer**. For example the [Reading Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-reading) could help Instructors and researchers answer questions such as:

 - Who is consuming the content?
 - What materials are being accessed?
 - When are the resources accessed?
 - How often is the content viewed?
 - What paths are taken to reach the content?

 These examples are given in each profile section in the Caliper specification document.

### Profile Requirements

 Each profile is a collection of one or more Caliper events that together help describe a set of related activities. Each Event type included in a profile places constraints on the entities and actions that can be used. Vocabulary restrictions are outlined in each profile description under the following headings:

* supported events
* supported actors
* supported actions
* supported objects
* supported target entities
* supported generated entities
* other requirements

For example, the [Forum Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-forum) models a set of activities associated with online discussions involving instructors and learners. The profile currently includes a <code>ForumEvent</code>, <code>MessageEvent</code>, <code>NavigationEvent</code>, <code>ThreadEvent</code> and <code>ViewEvent</code>. You can see those events clearly defined in the table in the Forum Profile documentation.

The sequence of events from a Forum Profile implementation might involve a learner navigating to a forum, subscribing to it, viewing a thread, posting a message in reply to an earlier post and then marking the message as read.

### Profiles are used for certification

Profiles also serve as the unit of certification for Caliper. The [Caliper Conformance and Certification Guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2/cert) describes the certification process and requirements. Each profile has a section that, in addition to clearly displaying what the certification requirements are, gives an excellent overview of each Event Type and the supported Actions.

### Creating new profiles

The official Caliper specification will never be able to describe every Event or activity needed for all institutions, districts, and vendors. The Caliper workgroup and Product Steering committee are charged with working with all parties to help create new profiles as needed to help the community continue to move forward. Caliper has a profile extension mechanism for adding new profiles without having to release a whole new version of Caliper. Please use the [Caliper Public Forums](https://www.imsglobal.org/forums/ims-glc-public-forums-and-resources/caliper-analytics-public-forum) to discuss any needs with the group.


## Sending Events to an endpoint

### Envelopes are required

Caliper Event and Entity data MUST be transmitted inside a Caliper [Envelope](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#envelope), a purpose-built JSON data structure that includes metadata about the emitting [Sensor](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#sensor) and the data payload.

A Caliper envelope MUST contain the <code>sensor</code>, <code>sendTime</code>, <code>dataVersion</code> and <code>data</code> properties.  Each property MUST be referenced only once. No custom properties are permitted.

The <code>data</code> element can contain multiple Events and Entities. It is good practice to batch related Events if your Sensor is structured to do so.

#### Base Envelope JSON

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "sensor": "https://example.edu/sensors/1",
  "sendTime": "2020-01-15T11:05:01.000Z",
  "dataVersion": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "data": [ {event1}, {event2}, {eventN}]
}
</code></pre>

#### Example Envelope with an Event JSON

<pre><code class="json">

### Sending to a secured HTTP endpoint

The current standard way of sending Caliper events is via a secured HTTP endpoint using an <code>Authorization</code> header with a <code>Bearer</code> token. This is described in the Caliper spec [HTTP Request](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#httpRequest) section.

This is currently the only method supported for [Caliper Conformance](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2/cert).

An application that wants to send these events must either work with a Caliper Consumer directly to get an endpoint URL and authorization token, or use the connection passed via an [LTI service connection](#lti-learning-tools-interoperability).

### Other ways to send Events

Although HTTP messages with an authorization header is the only method currently supported for certification, there are many other ways a Caliper Sensor could send events to a Caliper Consumer. Each integration should use the mechanisms that work best for them and allow the desired scaling possibilities.

For example, a common method is putting Caliper Events into a queue like Amazon's SQS service and providing the Caliper Consumer the ability to connect to the queue for consumption.


## Consuming Caliper Events

There are many considerations for consuming Caliper Events. This document will discuss some high-level issues, but the many privacy and security implications of receiving and holding learner data must be managed by a team capable of implementing the proper infrastructure.

### Authorization

As discussed above in [Sending to a secured HTTP endpoint](#sending-to-a-secured-http-endpoint), the current standard for authenticating Caliper Events from a sender is via an <code>Authorization</code> header with a <code>Bearer</code> token. This is described in the Caliper spec [HTTP Request](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#httpRequest) section. Each learning tool a Caliper Consumer wishes to receive events from will require an exchange of an HTTPS endpoint to send the events to and an authorization token. Another method is using the LTI Caliper Connector service.

If a consumer of Caliper data is utilizing the [LTI service connection](#lti-learning-tools-interoperability) in conjunction with an LMS implementing that LTI service, they will have to work together to establish the needed connection and authorization infrastructure.

There are many other methods of sending and receiving events such as utilizing a queueing system. These are excellent options but they're not covered in this document.

### What implementation considerations exist for Caliper Consumers?
Several implementation considerations exist for Caliper Consumers. Typically, these consumers play a role during the initial ingestion portion of an overall data "pipeline". In such a pipeline, raw source data is emitted or generated, then ingested into a "Data Lake".  A Data Lake is a storage repository than can store large amounts of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data.  Ultimately, the benefit of a data lake approach is to enable flexibility, providing a place for data to be gathered from multiple sources in a variety of formats.

The following best practices are typically recommended for data pipeline components that process Caliper data:

- **Use Cheap Storage to Preserve Raw Event Messages.** Many Caliper consumers use cheap storage buckets in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage to preserve raw event messages.  Storage components such as AWS S3 can support annotation with metadata for cataloging purposes, and integrates with other AWS services such as AWS Glue, Lambda and Kinesis that will serve as components of the data lake.
- **Take Advantage of Stream Processing Components.** Cloud infrastructure components such as AWS Kinesis Firehose are useful for bundling groups of Caliper messages arriving at the same time into JSON files, which are then kept in folders organized by year/month/day/hour. In addition, components such as AWS Kinesis Analytics can be used to keep running totals or to detect anomalies in event streams.
- **Set Up Ingest Processes With Known Mapping and Transform Rules.** Examples of tasks which may need to be performed with inbound Caliper data are as follows:
   - Identify and locate common identifiers across the incoming data records.
   - Identify mappings between similar but differently named data fields and define logic for any transformations (parsing out specific identifiers from string fields, for example).
   - Determine how to handle display fields that contain strings that might be too long or have unsupported characters
   - Some data records may not contain an identifier that can be used to commonly join them across sources.  In those cases, you will need to maintain a set of mapping tables with locally-sourced identifiers and their mappings to global identifiers.
   - This may mean that you need to manufacture a global set of identifiers to unify the data across systems.
   - Coordinate and communicate with any departments/groups who own or can help locate the "source of truth" for identifiers.
- **Donâ€™t Forget About Reference Data.** Set up processes to bring in reference data (users, departments, calendar events, work project names).


## Code Libraries

Caliper makes available reference implementations for Sensors in the following programming languages.  Links are provided to the GitHub repositories for each

- [Caliper-JS](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-js)

## Use Cases
This section describes a handful common scenarios for the Caliper Specification.  This section is in no way comprehensive but is intended to give the reader an idea of the type of education ecosystem questions that Caliper Analytics&reg; can help to answer for.

### Student Facing Analytics

As students interact with content within an LMS course site, Caliper events are triggered and transported to an event store. The Caliper events are represented in the controlled vocabulary of the Caliper metric profiles. The events are then parsed to extract commonly sought values into columns in a relational database. For example, information such as the event type, the event action, event time, actor, and course is extracted. The event record can also be enriched using related information based on global identifiers such as the course and actor which facilitates joining data from multiple sources.

Downstream analytics applications can then query the event store for events that represent select interactions the students within a course have had with learning content such as a student previewing a file, starting a video, or reviewing a lecture recording. Those events are then visualized so that a student can see what percentage of the class has viewed those resources, when I as the student last viewed that file, and how many times Iâ€™ve viewed it. Students can use this information to gauge their performance against their peers and take corrective actions where there may be an issue.

### Understanding value of licensed learning tools

Using the same Caliper data being collected at the course level in the prior scenario, but at the cohort or system level, can be leveraged to determine in aggregate how much usage a licensed tool is getting across a cohort or within a segment of students. This data could be used to determine when it is safe to perform upgrades when it is time to begin migration planning or other operational concerns with various learning tools

### Profile Use Cases

Caliper Metric profiles represent foundational usage cases.  Each Metric Profile has it's own subset of use cases and user stories listed in it's primary specification document as linked to in this document.

Make sure to get a use case that decides why and how to add custom extensions.

Need to add use cases for all action types for each profile ( request from issue #196)

## Best Practices and FAQ

Below are some of the collected best practices from members who have successfully implemented the Caliper Analytics&reg; standard.

### How often is Caliper updated?

Major Caliper releases of the base specification will not be released more frequently than every 18 months. This is to help help the market have confidence in upgrading to the latest version each time. However, there are extension mechanisms in place to provide sufficient flexibility for all current uses. New Metric Profiles can also be created and published without a new release of Caliper.

### How much data should be sent in an Event?

Deciding what data to send depends heavily on the context and use-case. The consumer and producers of the Caliper Events should work together to figure what what is needed. Here are some considerations for this conversation:

- Data generated by the emitter which would otherwise be lost (i.e. not persisted) is a good candidate to convey in a Caliper event.
- Data that is readily accessible via dereferenceble IRI's, it is OK to include just the IRI's.
- If there are cases where downstream processes would need quick access to the actual generated data, it is ok to include those data values as well.
- It can be good to only emit what you generate: in other words, if your application has to do any extra work to retrieve related information, it's not recommended to include it in the event payload.

### How are sessions tracked across multiple LTI tools?

When receiving an LTI Launch via the [LTI service connection](#lti-learning-tools-interoperability) use the <code>caliper_federated_session_id</code> as the <code>id</code> of the <code>LtiSession</code> you include in events:

<pre><code class="json">
 {
   "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
   "type": "LtiSession"
 }
</code></pre>

You add it to an event using the <code>federatedSession</code> key:

<pre><code class="json">
 {
   "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
   "id": "urn:uuid:9r34jdfj-a0d8-4430-95bd-783ffae4d916",
   "type": "ToolUseEvent",
   "eventTime": "2020-01-15T11:15:00.000Z",
   "actor": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
   "action": "Used",
   "object": "https://example.edu",
   "federatedSession": {
     "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
     "type": "LtiSession"
   }
 }
</code></pre>

#### Other LTI Entity IDs

There is a lot of other information that can be passed along with an LTI Launch. Here are some guidelines to consider when deciding what information to include with your Caliper events:

- pick out the system identifiers from the LTI message that are relevant to you as a Tool, and put them in as SystemIdentifiers on the _entities_ in your events that are relevant. This helps:
   - bind those identifiers to the things they belong to, and not to the "session"
   - data consumers easily find those properties rather than having to dig through a big bag of <code>Event.federatedSession.messageProperties</code> keys.
 - Any identifiers generated by your app should be represented as first class properties in the Caliper event; however any identifiers which were passed into your application (say as LTI launch parameters) should be included as federatedSession properties.

#### Other LTI Launch Information

You might want to capture the <code>messageParameters</code> from an LTI launch message and include those in the federated session property, but the message bodies are quite large, and you should prefer to rely in the federated session ID to retrieve any needed information unless you have a specific purpose for including all that information.

Here is an example of adding extra LTI information into the <code>LtiSession</code> object:

<pre><code class="json">
{
   "id": "urn:uuid:1c519ff7-3dfa-4764-be48-d2fb35a2925a",
   "type": "LtiSession",
   "user": "https://example.edu/users/554433",

       "edu_example_course_section_instructor": "https://example.edu/faculty/1234"
     }
   },
   "dateCreated": "2020-01-15T10:15:00.000Z",
   "startedAtTime": "2020-01-15T10:15:00.000Z"
 }
</code></pre>

### Including Identifiers from other systems

All Entities support an ordered collection of [SystemIdentifier](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#SystemIdentifier) entities that represent other identifiers for the Entity that are known to the Sensor. The list of supported types and their descriptions can be found in the main Caliper specification here: [identifierTypes](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#systemidentifiertype).

Here is an example of adding an extra <code>LisSourcedId</code> identifier to a course offering:
<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201601/courses/7",
  "type": "CourseOffering",
  "courseNumber": "CPS 435",
  "academicSession": "Fall 2016",
  "name": "CPS 435 Learning Analytics",
  "otherIdentifiers": [
    {
      "type": "SystemIdentifier",
      "identifier": "example.edu:SI182-F16",
      "identifierType": "LisSourcedId"
    }
  ],
  "dateCreated": "2016-08-01T06:00:00.000Z",
  "dateModified": "2016-09-02T11:30:00.000Z"
}
</code></pre>

The main Caliper documentation has other examples if you scroll to the example JSON after the properties table: [CourseOffering](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#CourseOffering), [CourseSection](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#CourseSection), [Person](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#Person), [Envelope with Mixed Payload Example](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#jsonldPayload)


### Robustness expectations

As an _analytics_ specification, Caliper is not generally well suited to other uses that require more robust guarantees around timeliness and completeness.  A few items of consideration are listed below.

- Caliper is _not_ specified as a messaging or transaction service
- There are no guarantees around delivery timing in the specification
- Events in Caliper are _not_ ordered and may come much later, or in batches, etc.
- Any integration parties may plan to use events as transaction but they will need to design their requirements together and not rely on Caliper certification implying others meet their extra expectations.
- Using Caliper for official grade or enrollment data exchange is not recommended. Use the other IMS specifications built to solve those integration problems.


### JSON-LD

[JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/2018/jsonld-cg-reports/json-ld/) is a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with Linked Data. The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that support JSON-LD


## Caliper in the IMS ecosystem

As an analytics standard, Caliper is relevant to almost every other IMS specification in some way. These sections will cover some of ways Caliper interacts with other specifications.


### CASE - Competencies and Academic Standards Exchange

[CASE](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/case) is used to align learning content and activities with academic standards. It might be useful to pass the CASE standard a Caliper <code>Entity</code> is aligned with via a [LearningObjective](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#LearningObjective) <code>Entity</code> included with the <code>Object</code> in a Caliper <code>Event</code>.

Researchers and analytics who collect data aligned to learning objectives can use it to correlate between learning activities and academic standards.

Wherever CASE-aligned learning objectives are associated to [DigitalResources](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#DigitalResource) you may want to include them in the <code>learningObjectives</code> array on your resource.

If the Caliper endpoint is able to retrieve this information from another source then it may be better to not include the <code>LearningObjective</code> to help keep the Caliper Event's JSON smaller.

Here is an example of a CASE <code>LearningObjective</code> with a full object (<code>name</code> and <code>description</code> are _optional_)

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/202001/courses/7/sections/1/assign/2",
  "type": "AssignableDigitalResource",
  "name": "Reading Assignment: Research techniques",
  "learningObjectives": [
    {
      "id": "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5e8130-46fa-11e7-b197-cd3432e719f9",
      "type": "LearningObjective",
      "name": "Research techniques",
      "description": "ELAGSE1RL1 Ask and answer questions about key details in a text."
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

For brevity, it also valid to just include the <code>id</code> in the <code>learningObjectives</code> array like this:

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "https://example.edu/terms/202001/courses/7/sections/1/assign/2",
  "type": "AssignableDigitalResource",
  "name": "Reading Assignment: Research techniques",
  "learningObjectives": [
    "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5e8130-46fa-11e7-b197-cd3432e719f9",
    "https://case.georgiastandards.org/ims/case/v1p0/CFItems/2f5eda0e-46fa-11e7-b90a-62096a00843f"
  ]
}
</code></pre>


### LTI - Learning Tools Interoperability


#### How does an LTI Tool know where to send Caliper events?

An LTI Tool can use the [LTI Caliper Connector](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-spec-Caliper/blob/master/docs/lti-spec-caliper.md) service to retrieve a Caliper endpoint to send events to and get an authorization token from.

This service also specifies that the <code>Caliper.sessionId</code> value should be sent on an LTI launch. This is what Caliper calls the "Federated Session ID" as described in the [How are sessions tracked across multiple LTI tools?](#how-are-sessions-tracked-across-multiple-lti-tools) section.


#### How can I track how much LTI tools are used and privacy issues around them?

For the institutions that heavily use LTI tools they often want to know how much a tool is used, and what information about the student and class is being sent to 3rd party vendors. There are 2 Caliper Profiles that help make this information available to faculty and administrators.

#### Tool Launch Profile & LTI Insights

The [Tool Use](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-tooluse) and [Tool Launch](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-toollaunch) profiles are meant to help understand how LTI tools are used at an institution. Their use is highly recommended for all LTI tools.

The [LTI Insights](https://www.imsglobal.org/lti-insights) is a great example of monitering LTI usage at an institution.


### LTI Resource Search

[LTI Resource Search](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/lti-resource-search) is a standard that defines how to search digital repositories for a set of resources. It addresses searching learning object repositories (LORs), and other catalogs of learning resources, from learning tools using various attributes of resources and returning full metadata about the resources to the learning tools. Results can be launched either as URLs or LTI links.

If you wish to collect Caliper analytics events for users interacting with a Resource Search application, you can use the [SearchEvent](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#SearchEvent) that is within the [Search Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-search).

In Caliper terms, a search "generates" a <code>SearchResponse</code> object to be included in the event. You can read the details in the [SearchResponse documentation](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#SearchResponse).

The <code>searchProvider</code> is the SoftwareApplication providing the search interface and returning the results. The <code>searchTarget</code> is what is being searched such as a text book or LOR application. Both these fields are optional but may be useful depending on your use case. Generally the <code>object</code> of the Search Event should be the same as the <code>searchTarget</code>.

Since the <code>SearchResponse</code> will usually be a desired object to include, this event will usually be sent <em>after</em> the search results have been generated, not before.

The <code>id</code> of the <code>Query</code> should be the URL used for the search. The <code>id</code> of the <code>SearchResponse</code> can be any IRI, but depending on your usage, it may useful to also make that ID contain the search URL.

This is an example of what a Resource Search event might look like:

<pre><code class="json">
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2",
  "id": "urn:uuid:cb3878ed-8240-4c6d-9fee-77221810f5e4",

    }
  }
}
</code></pre>


### OneRoster & LIS

Caliper Entities can contain a lot of contextual information beyond the interaction described in an Event. However, it isn't always good practice to include all that information because that can make your Events very large and repetitive. In many cases it's preferred to include as little contextual information as possible in an included Entity or Agent to keep the amount of data being sent to a minimum. In this case, since that contextual information is still likely needed for analysis, services like OneRoster and LIS can be used to fetch that information from SIS systems allowing you to get everything needed about a user, course, or section.

The identifiers included in your Caliper Events should be aligned to the identifiers in these SIS systems to allow this functionality. When planning an analytics project, you should make sure all the appropriate IDs are included for your needs.

For instructions on how to do that see the section [Including Identifiers from other systems](#including-identifiers-from-other-systems).

### OpenVideo

The [Media Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-media) can be used by platforms implementing [OpenVideo](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/openvideo).


### QTI - Question and Test Interoperability

For a learner's interactions within a [QTI](https://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html) assessment the [Assessment Profile](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/caliper/v1p2#profile-assessment) should be used. This profile is useful for all assessments whether driven by QTI or not allowing researchers and tool creators to send events about assessment generically.
