        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <section class="informative">
            <h3>Design Goals and Rationale</h3>

            <p>Delivering teaching and learning at scale is encouraging adoption of “big data” practices.  Cloud computing
                and machine learning are changing both the learning technology landscape and the business of education.
                The definition of what constitutes learning is also evolving beyond the formal classroom experience to
                include informal, social and experiential modes of acquiring knowledge and skills. Opportunities exist
                to leverage new tools, tap new data sources, ask new questions and pursue new insights.</p>

            <p>Consider the enterprising instructor seeking to augment if not transform the classroom environment for her
                students.  She utilizes a video platform to create and post video assignments. Class discussions and Q&A
                sessions are conducted online using another service. She administers her course using a learning management
                system.  Three services, three vendors, three potential sources of learning data.</p>

            <p>Analyzing the viewing behavior of her students in relation to the questions they pose about her course
                content is vital to understanding student comprehension and performance. Yet exploring such relationships
                is all too often a challenging exercise. Likely there are significant barriers to overcome. Is the data
                required for analysis actually collected? If it exists, who owns it? If ownership is not an issue what
                about privacy concerns? If privacy protocols are in place is the data easy to retrieve? If retrievable
                how difficult is it to combine with data sourced from other platforms?</p>

            <p>The Caliper Analytics&reg; specification seeks to address a number of the issues outlined above by providing
                a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data. Establishing a
                common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data
                interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.</p>

            <p>Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and
                transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.
                Industry-wide adoption of Caliper offers the tantalizing prospect of a more unified learning data
                environment in which to build new and innovative services designed to measure, infer, predict, report and
                visualize.</p>

        <section id="terminology">
            <h3>Terminology</h3>

            <p><a name="actorDef"></a><strong>Actor</strong>: An <code>actor</code> is an <a href="#agent">Agent</a> capable
                of initiating or performing an <code>action</code> on a thing or as part of a process. A Caliper
                <a href="#event">Event</a> includes an <code>actor</code> attribute for representing the
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="blankNodeDef"></a><strong>Blank Node Identifier</strong>: a string that begins with "_:" that is
                used to identify an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> for which an <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> is not provided.
                An <a href="#entity">Entity</a> provisioned with a blank node identifier is neither dereferenceable nor has
                meaning outside the scope of the <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> document within which it resides.</p>

           <p><a name="actionDef"></a><strong>Action</strong>: something performed or done to accomplish a purpose. Caliper
               <a href="#event">Event</a> subtypes define a controlled vocabulary of one or more
               <a href="#actions">actions</a> relevant to the activity domain. A Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a>
               includes an <code>action</code> attribute for expressing the associated <code>action</code>.</p>

            <p><a name="contextDef"></a><strong>Context</strong>: a special
                <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> keyword that maps the terms employed in a
                JSON document to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt">IRIs</a> that link to one or more published
                vocabularies. Inclusion of a <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> context provides
                an economical way of communicating document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event
                data.</p>

            <p><a name="describeDef"></a><strong>Describe</strong>: a Caliper message containing an <a href="#entity">Entity</a>
                that is not directly associated with an <a href="#event">Event</a>. Entities can be sent asynchronously using
                <em>Describe</em> messages in order to reduce verbosity (e.g. sending a <a href="#person">Person</a> entity
                as a <em>Describe</em> avoids having to repeat the <a href="#person">Person</a> object in each
                <a href="#event">Event</a> that includes it).</p>

            <p><a name="endpointDef"></a><strong>Endpoint</strong>: a receiver or consumer of Caliper data that is bound
                to a specific network protocol.</p>

            <p><a name="entityDef"></a><strong>Entity</strong>: an object or a thing that participates in learning-related
                activity. Caliper <a href="#entity">Entity</a> types provide coarsed-grained representations of applications,
                people, groups and resources that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a>.
                Each <a href="#entity">Entity</a> corresponds to a node in a directed graph.</p>

            <p><a name="envelopeDef"></a><strong>Envelope</strong>: a data structure that serves as a transport container
                of Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> data.  The envelope also includes
                metadata about the emitting <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> and the data payload.</p>

            <p><a name="eventDef"></a><strong>Event</strong>: describes a relationship established between an
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a> (the <code>actor</code>) and an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> (the
                <code>object</code>) formed as a result of a purposeful <code>action</code> undertaken by the
                <code>actor</code> in connection to the <code>object</code> at a particular moment in time.</p>

            <p><a name="jsonldDef"></a><strong>JSON-LD</strong>: a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization
                and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a>.
                The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that
                support <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="iriDef"></a><strong>IRI</strong>: The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) extends the
                Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#uriDef">URI</a>) scheme by using characters drawn from the Universal
                character set rather than US-ASCII per <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt">RFC 3987</a>.
                <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a> rely on IRIs to refer to most nodes and properties.</p>

            <p><a name="iso8601Def"></a><strong>ISO 8601</strong>: Caliper data and time values are formatted per
                ISO 8601 with the addition of millisecond precision. The format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ where 'T'
                separates the date from the time while 'Z' indicates that the time is set to UTC.</p>

            <p><a name="linkedDataDef"></a><strong>Linked Data</strong>: A set of design principles first articulated
                by Tim Berners-Lee for discovering, connecting, and sharing structured data over the Web. The principles
                can be summarized as follows: use <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> as names for things;
                use HTTP <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> so that information about things (e.g., people,
                objects, concepts) can be retrieved using a standard format; link out to other relevant things by way of
                their <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>/<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> in order to promote discovery of new relationships
                between things.</p>

            <p><a name="lisDef"></a><strong>LIS</strong>: Learning Information Services&reg; (LIS&reg;) [[!LIS-20]] is an
                IMS standard that defines how systems manage the exchange of information that describes people, groups,
                memberships, courses and outcomes.</p>

            <p><a name="ltiDef"></a><strong>LTI</strong>: Learning Tools Interoperability&reg; (LTI&reg;) [[!LTI-13]] is an
                IMS standard for integration of rich learning applications within educational environments.</p>

            <p><a name="profileDef"></a><strong>Profile</strong>: models a learning activity or a supporting
                activity that helps facilitate learning.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts
                that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent
                manner using a shared vocabulary.</p>

            <p><a name="objectDef"></a><strong>Object</strong>: an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> that an
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a> interacts with that becomes the focus, target or object of an interaction.
                A Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> includes an <code>object</code> attribute for representing the
                resource.</p>

            <p><a name="sensorDef"></a><strong>Sensor</strong>: Software assets deployed within a learning application that
                implement the <a href="#sensorAPIDef">Sensor API&trade;</a> for marshalling and transmitting Caliper data to
                a target endpoint.</p>

            <p><a name="sensorAPIDef"></a><strong>Sensor API&trade;</strong>: The standard set of methods and supported
                parameters that a <a href="#sensorDef">Sensor</a> implements according to this specification in order
                to transmit Caliper data in an interoperable way.</p>

            <p><a name="termDef"></a><strong>Term</strong>: a word or short expression that expands to an
                <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> when mapped to a JSON-LD <a href="#contextDef">context</a> document. Terms are
                employed by Caliper as <code>type</code> property string values in order to distinguish between various
                JSON representations of entities and events defined by the Caliper information model.</p>

            <p><a name="typeCoercionDef"></a><strong>Type Coercion</strong>: the process of coercing values to a particular
                data type.</p>

            <p><a name="uriDef"></a><strong>URI</strong>:  the Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#uriDef">URI</a>)
                utilizes the US-ASCII character set to identify a resource. Per <a href="#rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> a
                <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> "can be further classified as a locator, a name or both."  Both the Uniform
                Resource Locator (<a href="#urlDef">URL</a>) and the Uniform Resource Name (<a href="#urnDef">URN</a>)
                are considered subspaces of the more general <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> space.

            <p><a name="urlDef"></a><strong>URL</strong>: A Uniform Resource Locator (<a href="#urlDef">URL</a>) is a
                type of <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> that provides a reference to resource that specifies both its location
                and a means of retrieving a representation of it.  An HTTP <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> is a
                <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> and using HTTP <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> to identify
                things is fundamental to <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="urnDef"></a><strong>URN</strong>: A Uniform Resource Name (<a href="#urnDef">URN</a>) is a type
                of <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> that provides a persistent identifier for a resource that is bound to a
                defined namespace.  Unlike a <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> is location-independent
                and provides no means of accessing a representation of the named resource.</p>

            <p><a name="uuidDef"></a><strong>UUID</strong>: a 128-bit identifier that does not require a registration
                authority to assure uniqueness. However, absolute uniqueness is not guaranteed although the collision
                probability is considered extremely low. Caliper recommends use of randomly or pseudo-randomly
                generated version 4 UUIDs. Each Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> MUST be assigned a UUID that is
                expressed as a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> using the form <code>urn:uuid:&lt;UUID&gt;</code> as described in
                <a href="#rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Information Model</h2>

        <p>The Caliper information model defines a set of concepts, rules, and relationships for describing learning
            activities.  Each activity domain modeled is described in a Caliper <a href="#profileDef">Profile</a>.
            Each profile is composed of one or more <a href="#Event">Event</a> types. Each <a href="#Event">Event</a>
            defines a controlled vocabulary of <a href="actions">actions</a> undertaken by learners, instructors, and others,
            that are scoped to the event. Various <a href="#Entity">Entity</a> types representing people, groups, and resources
            are provided in order to better describe both the relationships established between participating entities
            and the contextual elements relevant to the interaction.

        <h2>Profiles</h2>

        <img height="100%" width="100%" src="assets/caliper-profiles-v3.png" alt="Caliper Profiles"/>

        <p>The Caliper information model defines a number of profiles, each of which models a learning activity or a
            supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  A profile's <em>raison d'etre</em> is to encourage vocabulary
            standardization and re-use among application providers delivering complementary, albeit competing capabilities
            that collect learning activity data.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that
            application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner
            using a shared vocabulary.  Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment
            submission represent a few examples of the many activities or events that Caliper's profiles attempt to
            describe.</p>

        <p>
            Think of each profile as a stand-alone, logical container, or collection of one or more Caliper events
            that together help describe a set of inter-related activities.  Each <a href="#Event">Event</a> type included in a
            profile place constraints on the various entities and actions that can be utilized to describe a
            learning activity. Vocabulary restrictions are outlined in each profile description under the following
            headings:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>supported events</li>

        <p>As an example, the <a href="#ForumProfile">Forum Profile</a> models a set of activities associated
            with online discussions involving instructors and learners. The profile currently includes a
            <a href="#ForumEvent">ForumEvent</a>, <a href="#MessageEvent">MessageEvent</a>,
            <a href="#NavigationEvent">NavigationEvent</a>, <a href="#ThreadEvent">ThreadEvent</a> and
            <a href="#ViewEvent">ViewEvent</a>. An action sequence mediated by the
            <a href="#ForumProfile">Forum Profile</a> might involve a learner navigating to a forum, subscribing
            to it, viewing a thread, posting a message in reply to an earlier post and then marking the message as
            read.</p>

        <p>
            Extending Caliper's information model involves designing a new profile or enhancing an existing one.
            Implementers are free to implement only those Caliper profiles as are necessary to model a learning
            domain. A video platform provider may decide that only the
            <a href="#AssignableProfile">Assignable Profile</a>, <a href="#MediaProfile">Media Profile</a> and
            <a href="#SessionProfile">Session Profile</a> are relevant to its needs, while developers instrumenting
            an assessment engine would most likely implement the <a href="#AssessmentProfile">Assessment Profile</a>,
            <a href="#GradingProfile">Grading Profile</a> and <a href="#SessionProfile">Session Profile</a>.</p>

        <h2>Serialization of the Model</h2>

        <p>Over the last decade the advent of cloud-based, networked applications have led to changes in the way data
            is structured and represented.  Data once considered strictly hierarchical, like a curriculum, a course
            roster, or a transcript now frequently link out to other kinds of data.  Modeling bundles of data pointing
            to other bundles of data now requires thinking in terms of graphs and <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a>.
            Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> data presents us with similar structures. A Caliper
            <a href="#event">Event</a> can link to user data, digital content, courses and rosters, grades and
            credentials, institutional and organizational data, application and session data, and so on, the sources of
            which are likely diverse and the opportunities for discovering new relationships between the entities
            represented therein both numerous as well as enlightening.</p>

        <p>Exchanging data linked to other data distributed across a wide network requires both a simple,
            well-understood data-interchange format as well as means of defining unambiguously the underlying
            semantics or meaning intended for the data structures transmitted from one machine to another. For Caliper,
            <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> provides the necessary representational horsepower to both describe these
            kinds of data linkages and specify how data is to be understood when published and shared across a
            network.</p>

        <p><a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> defines an economical syntax for representing learning activity data
            as <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a> using <a href="#jsonDef">JSON</a> as the underlying
            data-interchange format. <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> also provides an API and set of processing
            algorithms for working with <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> documents that are based on different contexts.
            Algorithms have also been developed to serialize <a href="#rdf">RDF</a> as <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a>
            and deserialize a <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> document to an <a href="#rdf">RDF</a> data set.</p>

        <section id="serialization-jsonld-context">
            <h3>JSON-LD Context</h3>

            <p><a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> documents require inclusion of a <em>context</em>, denoted by the
                <code>@context</code> keyword, a property employed to map document <a href="#termDef">Terms</a> to
                <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>.  <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> contexts can be embedded inline or
                referenced externally in a document.  Inclusion of a <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context provides
                an economical way for Caliper to communicate document semantics to services interested in consuming
                Caliper event data.</p>

            <p>IMS Global provides a remote Caliper 1.1 <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context document
                (<a href="http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2/">http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2/</a>)
                for mapping Caliper <a href="#termDef">Terms</a> to <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>. Implementers are
                encouraged to familiarize themselves with the term definitions described therein.</p>

            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Each Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a>
                    <em><a href="#describeDef">describe</a></em> document generated by a <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a>
                    MUST be provisioned with a <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> <code>@context</code> defined as a
                    property of the top-level object.</li>
                <li>The top-level <code>@context</code> property type MUST be defined as a string or an array.</li>
                <li>If the top-level <code>@context</code> value is defined as a string it MUST be set to the Caliper
                    remote context URL "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2".</li>
                <li>If the top-level <code>@context</code> value is defined as an array of multiple contexts, the
                    remote Caliper <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context MUST be listed last in order to ensure that
                    Caliper terms retain their primacy given that <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> parsers rely on a
                    "most-recently-defined-wins" approach when evaluating duplicate terms.</li>
                <li>Referencing the remote Caliper <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context document in the top-level
                    <code>@context</code> is mandatory.  The terms it defines MUST NOT be defined inline as an
                    object.</li>
                <li>Additional remote or inline <em>local</em> contexts may be referenced any time a JSON object is
                    defined in order to ascribe meaning to terms not described by the model. These contexts are additive
                    in nature and can be defined as a string, object or array.  Duplicate context references SHOULD be
                    omitted when serializing the object.  Nested <em>local</em> contexts that are added to the
                    <em>active</em> context at processing time MUST NOT override Caliper terms defined by the top-level
                    context.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the following example, <code>@context</code> is a top-level <a href="#event">Event</a> property with
                a value that references the remote Caliper <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context document. All of the
                <a href="#event">Event</a> key:value pairings are mapped to [IRIs] in the referenced context.</p>

            <figure class="example">
                <figcaption>Referencing the Caliper JSON-LD context</figcaption>
                <pre><code>{

}</code></pre>
            </figure>

            <p>As noted above, a <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> document can reference more than one context. Subject
                to the requirements listed above additional contexts MAY be defined for a Caliper
                <a href="#event">Event</a> or <a href="#entity">Entity</a> <em><a href="#describeDef">describe</a></em>
                in order to map non-Caliper vocabulary terms to their respective <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>. The Caliper
                JSON-LD context MUST be listed last if an array of contexts is referenced.</p>

            <figure class="example">

  . . .
}</code></pre>
            </figure>

            <p>Contexts embedded inline can be combined with externally referenced contexts. Again, order matters.</p>

        <section id="serialization-identifiers">
            <h3>Identifiers</h3>

            <p><a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a> relies on <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>/<a href="#uriDefs">URIs</a>
                for the identification and retrieval of resources.  Likewise, <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> specifies
                the use of <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>/<a href="#uriDefs">URIs</a> for identifying most nodes
                (i.e., JSON objects) and their attributes.  Caliper too specifies the use of <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>
                for identifying nodes (i.e., the things or entities being described) and their attributes.</p>

            <p><a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> values MUST be absolute containing a scheme, path and optional query and
                fragment segments.  A <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> employing the <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> scheme MAY be
                used as an identifier although care should be taken when employing a location-independent identifier
                since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it in future to retrieve machine-readable data over
                HTTP. If an <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> is deemed inappropriate for the resource a
                <a href="#blankNodeDef">blank node</a> identifier may be assigned.</p>

            <p><a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> provides a special <code>@id</code> keyword for assigning identifiers
                to nodes. For Caliper, the <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> <code>@id</code> keyword is aliased as
                <code>id</code> in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD
                <a href="http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2">context</a>.  This is done in order to avoid the
                temptation of employing <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> keywords as property names and is aligned with
                <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> community practice.  Thus, each Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> and
                <a href="#entity">Entity</a> described by the model is provisioned with an <code>id</code> rather than
                <code>@id</code> property for identifying the resource.</p>

            <p>Every <a href="#entity">Entity</a> MUST be assigned an identifier in the form of a valid
                <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> or a blank node identifier. The <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> MUST be unique and
                persistent.  The <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> SHOULD be dereferenceable; i.e., capable of returning a
                representation of the <a href="#entity">Entity</a>.  A <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> employing the
                <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> scheme MAY also be utilized.</p>

            <p>Unlike Entities, each <a href="#event">Event</a> MUST be assigned a 128-bit long universally unique
                identifier (<a href="#uuidDef">UUID</a>) formatted as a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> per
                <a href="#rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>, which describes a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> namespace for
                <a href="#uuidDef">UUIDs</a>.</p>

            <h3>Types and Type Coercion</h3>

            <p><a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> employs the <code>@type</code> keyword in two ways. Individual
                <em>nodes</em> (i.e., the thing being described) can be assigned a type.  Values can also be associated

                of <code>@id</code> as <code>id</code>, the <code>@type</code> keyword is aliased as <code>type</code>
                in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD <a href="http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2">context</a>
                in keeping with <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> community practice.</p>

            <p>Caliper permits <a href="#entity">Entity</a> values to be expressed either as a JSON object or as a
                string corresponding to its <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a>.  <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> also supports
                the <em>coercion</em> of data values to specified types based on value type mappings defined in a
                <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> context.  For a given <code>@type</code> the keywords <code>@id</code>
                or <code>@vocab</code> may be assigned as a value in order to signal to a
                <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> parser that if a term's instance value is set to a string it is to be
                interpreted as an <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a>.  Type coercion of this sort provides representational
                flexibility that implementers are encouraged to leverage.</p>

            <p>The following <a href="#messageEvent">MessageEvent</a> example utilizes an inline context to illustrate
                how <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> types can be specified in a context. The
                <a href="#messageEvent">MessageEvent</a>, <a href="#person">Person</a> and
                <a href="#message">Message</a> terms are all considered node types. Other terms illustrate the
                coercion of values to specified data types.  In the example below, the values of the <code>actor</code>,
                <code>object</code> and <code>edApp</code> terms are coerced to the <code>@id</code> keyword. Use of
                this convention informs <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> parsers that string values are to be
                interpreted as <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> (as in the case of <code>edApp</code>). In a like manner,
                the <code>action</code> value is coerced to the <code>@vocab</code> keyword indicating that the value
                is to be interpreted as a <a href="#termDef">Term</a> defined in the active context or as an
                <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a>; in this case <em>Posted</em>.  Terms such as <code>name</code>,
                <code>description</code>, <code>dateCreated</code>, <code>dateModified</code> and <code>duration</code>
                are coerced to a particular value type such as a string, integer, boolean or date.</p>

        <img height="100%" width="100%" src="assets/caliper-sensor-v2.png" alt="Caliper Sensor">

        <p>Caliper defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling and transmitting data
            to a target endpoints.  Adopting one or more <a href="#profiles">profiles</a> ensures adherence
            to the information model; implementing the <code>Sensor</code> provides instrumented platforms,
            applications and services with a transport interface for communicating with data consumers.</p>

        <section id="sensor-behavior">
            <h3>Behavior</h3>

            <p>A <code>Sensor</code> MUST implement the following behaviors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>create in-memory object representations of Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> and
                    <a href="#entity">Entity</a> types as described in Section <a href="#infoModel">2.0</a>. The particular
                    <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> types that a <code>Sensor</code>
                    must be capable of expressing are determined by the <a href="#profiles">profiles</a>
                    implemented as described in Section <a href="#profiles">3.0</a>.</li>
                <li>express <a href="#entity">Entity</a> values as either an object or a string corresponding to the
                    resource's <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> as described in Section <a href="#entity">2.2</a>.</li>
                <li>serialize in-memory <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> objects as
                    <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> as described in Section <a href="#serialization">4.0</a>.</li>
                <li>create an in-memory object representation of a Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a> as
                    described in Section <a href="#envelope">5.2</a>.</li>
                <li>serialize in-memory Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a> objects as JSON as described in
                    Section <a href="#envelope">5.2</a>.  <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a>
                    <em><a href="#describeDef">describe</a></em> data serialized as JSON-LD MUST be transmitted inside
                    an <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a> as described in Sections <a href="#envelope">5.2</a> and
                    <a href="#jsonldPayload">5.3</a>.</li>
                <li>transmit serialized Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelopes</a> containing <a href="#event">Event</a>

            </ul>

            <p>A <code>Sensor</code> MAY be assigned other responsibilities such as validating Caliper
                <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> data but such capabilities need not be

        <h2>Endpoint</h2>

        <p>A Caliper <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MUST be capable of receiving Caliper data sent over HTTP by a
            Caliper <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> using the standard POST request method. The connection MUST be
            secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and a valid TLS certificate provided. The
            <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MUST be capable of accessing standard HTTP request headers and support
            message authentication that utilizes the HTTP <code>Authorization</code> request header &quot;Bearer&quot;
            authentication scheme as described in <a href="#rfc6750">RFC 6750</a>,
            <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2">Section 2.1</a>.</p>


        <section id="httpResponse">
            <h3>HTTP Responses</h3>

            <p>Following receipt of a <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> HTTP request message, the
                <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MUST reply with an HTTP response message. The response will include
                a three-digit status code indicating whether or not the <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> was able to
                understand and satisfy the request, as defined by <a href="#rfc7231">RFC 7231</a>.</p>

            <p>When signalling to a <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> that the endpoint has successfully received the
                request message, the <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MUST reply with a <code>2xx</code> class status
                code. By best practice, the <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> SHOULD use the <code>200 OK</code> response
                but might instead choose to send a <code>201 Created</code> (to indicate successful receipt of the
                message and creation of a new resource) or a <code>202 Accepted</code> (to indicate successful receipt
                of the message and queueing for further processing). By best practice, the
                <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> SHOULD send back successful responses with an empty body.</p>

            <p>An <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MAY send back responses other than those with <code>2xx</code> class
                indicating success; if so, it MUST adhere to these response status codes for these specific cases
                (for other cases, the <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> may offer other responses):</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If the request message has no enclosing Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a>, reply with a
                        <code>400 Bad Request</code> status code.</li>
                <li>If the request message's Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a> is malformed (for example,
                        missing fields required by the Envelop's version), reply with a <code>400 Bad Request</code>
                        status code.</li>
                <li>If the <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> sends an unauthorized request, or the
                        <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> is unable to validate the authorization, or the
                        <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> cannot determine that the <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a>
                        has sufficient privilege to send such a message, reply with a <code>401 Unauthorized</code>.</li>
                <li>If the request message has a content-type other than <code>application/json</code>, reply with
                        a <code>415 Unsupported Media Type</code>.</li>
                <li>If the <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> cannot support the version of Caliper data indicated by
                        the Caliper <a href="#envelope">Envelope</a>'s <code>dataVersion</code> field, reply with
                        a <code>422 Unprocessable Entity</code> status code.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MAY respond to <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> messages with other
                standard HTTP status codes to indicate result dispositions that vary from the cases described above.
                The <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> MAY also communicate more detailed information about problem
                states, using the standard method for reporting problem details described in
                <a href="#rfc7807">RFC 7807</a>.</p>

            <p>Caliper <a href="#endpoint">Endpoint</a> implementers should bear in mind that some Caliper
                <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> implementations may lack sophisticated error handling.</p>

        <section id="stringLengths">
            <h3>String Lengths and Storage</h3>
            <p>Certain Caliper data properties are expressed as strings of variable length.
                <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> also defines a set of processing algorithms for transforming
                <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> documents in ways that can change the length of keys and values
                that are expressed as <a href="#iridDef">IRIs</a>, compact <a href="#iridDef">IRIs</a> or
                <a href="#termDef">Terms</a>.  Many implementers will choose to store each incoming
                <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> <em><a href="#describeDef">describe</a></em>
                received as a <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> document or as a graph data structure consisting of
                nodes, edges and properties.  Others may opt to normalize or &quot;flatten&quot; some or all of the nested
                JSON objects that comprise a Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> or <a href="#entity">Entity</a>. If the
                chosen persistence strategy involves normalizing Caliper semi-structured data, care should be taken to
                ensure that strings of character data can be stored without truncation. See
                <a href="#minSupportedStringLengths">Appendix G. Minimum Supported String Lengths</a> for a list of
                Caliper data properties and recommended <em>minimum</em> string lengths.</p>

        <h2>Actions</h2>

        <p>Caliper includes a vocabulary of actions for describing learning interactions. Each action <a href="#termDef">Term</a>
            is based on the past-tense form of an English (en-US) verb. An action <a href="#termDef">Term</a> can also
            indicate a change in a particular characteristic of the <code>object</code> (e.g., resolution, size, speed,
            volume). Each action <a href="#termDef">Term</a> is mapped to a persistent <a href="iriDef">IRI</a> listed
            in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD <a href="http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2">context</a>. Each
            action is also linked to a brief definition ("gloss") derived in whole or in part from Princeton
            University's WordNet&reg; project in order to eliminate ambiguity and aid natural language processing.</p>

        <p>Each Caliper <a href="#Event">Event</a> type supports one or more of the actions listed below.
            The <a href="#Event">Event</a> <code>action</code> property string value MUST be set to the appropriate
            <a href="termDef">Term</a>. Only one action may be specified per <a href="#Event">Event</a>.</p>
