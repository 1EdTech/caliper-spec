        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <section class="informative">
            <h3>Design Goals and Rationale</h3>

            <p>Delivering teaching and learning at scale is encouraging adoption of “big data” practices.  Cloud computing
                and machine learning are changing both the learning technology landscape and the business of education.
                The definition of what constitutes learning is also evolving beyond the formal classroom experience to
                include informal, social and experiential modes of acquiring knowledge and skills. Opportunities exist
                to leverage new tools, tap new data sources, ask new questions and pursue new insights.</p>

            <p>Consider the enterprising instructor seeking to augment if not transform the classroom environment for her
                students.  She utilizes a video platform to create and post video assignments. Class discussions and Q&A
                sessions are conducted online using another service. She administers her course using a learning management
                system.  Three services, three vendors, three potential sources of learning data.</p>

            <p>Analyzing the viewing behavior of her students in relation to the questions they pose about her course
                content is vital to understanding student comprehension and performance. Yet exploring such relationships
                is all too often a challenging exercise. Likely there are significant barriers to overcome. Is the data
                required for analysis actually collected? If it exists, who owns it? If ownership is not an issue what
                about privacy concerns? If privacy protocols are in place is the data easy to retrieve? If retrievable
                how difficult is it to combine with data sourced from other platforms?</p>

            <p>The Caliper Analytics&reg; specification seeks to address a number of the issues outlined above by providing
                a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data. Establishing a
                common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data
                interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.</p>

            <p>Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and
                transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.
                Industry-wide adoption of Caliper offers the tantalizing prospect of a more unified learning data
                environment in which to build new and innovative services designed to measure, infer, predict, report and
                visualize.</p>

            <h3>Terminology</h3>

            <p><a name="actorDef"></a><strong>Actor</strong>: An <code>actor</code> is an <a href="#agent">Agent</a> capable
                of initiating or performing an <code>action</code> on a thing or as part of a process. A Caliper
                <a href="#event">Event</a> includes an <code>actor</code> attribute for representing the
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="blankNodeDef"></a><strong>Blank Node Identifier</strong>: a string that begins with "_:" that is
                used to identify an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> for which an <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> is not provided.
                An <a href="#entity">Entity</a> provisioned with a blank node identifier is neither dereferenceable nor has
                meaning outside the scope of the <a href="#jsonldDef">JSON-LD</a> document within which it resides.</p>

           <p><a name="actionDef"></a><strong>Action</strong>: something performed or done to accomplish a purpose. Caliper
               <a href="#event">Event</a> subtypes define a controlled vocabulary of one or more
               <a href="#actions">actions</a> relevant to the activity domain. A Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a>
               includes an <code>action</code> attribute for expressing the associated <code>action</code>.</p>

            <p><a name="contextDef"></a><strong>Context</strong>: a special
                <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> keyword that maps the terms employed in a
                JSON document to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt">IRIs</a> that link to one or more published
                vocabularies. Inclusion of a <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> context provides
                an economical way of communicating document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event
                data.</p>

            <p><a name="describeDef"></a><strong>Describe</strong>: a Caliper message containing an <a href="#entity">Entity</a>
                that is not directly associated with an <a href="#event">Event</a>. Entities can be sent asynchronously using
                <em>Describe</em> messages in order to reduce verbosity (e.g. sending a <a href="#person">Person</a> entity
                as a <em>Describe</em> avoids having to repeat the <a href="#person">Person</a> object in each
                <a href="#event">Event</a> that includes it).</p>

            <p><a name="endpointDef"></a><strong>Endpoint</strong>: a receiver or consumer of Caliper data that is bound
                to a specific network protocol.</p>

            <p><a name="entityDef"></a><strong>Entity</strong>: an object or a thing that participates in learning-related
                activity. Caliper <a href="#entity">Entity</a> types provide coarsed-grained representations of applications,
                people, groups and resources that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a>.
                Each <a href="#entity">Entity</a> corresponds to a node in a directed graph.</p>

            <p><a name="envelopeDef"></a><strong>Envelope</strong>: a data structure that serves as a transport container
                of Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> and <a href="#entity">Entity</a> data.  The envelope also includes
                metadata about the emitting <a href="#sensor">Sensor</a> and the data payload.</p>

            <p><a name="eventDef"></a><strong>Event</strong>: describes a relationship established between an
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a> (the <code>actor</code>) and an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> (the
                <code>object</code>) formed as a result of a purposeful <code>action</code> undertaken by the
                <code>actor</code> in connection to the <code>object</code> at a particular moment in time.</p>

            <p><a name="jsonldDef"></a><strong>JSON-LD</strong>: a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization
                and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a>.
                The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that
                support <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="iriDef"></a><strong>IRI</strong>: The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) extends the
                Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#uriDef">URI</a>) scheme by using characters drawn from the Universal
                character set rather than US-ASCII per <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt">RFC 3987</a>.
                <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a> rely on IRIs to refer to most nodes and properties.</p>

            <p><a name="iso8601Def"></a><strong>ISO 8601</strong>: Caliper data and time values are formatted per
                ISO 8601 with the addition of millisecond precision. The format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ where 'T'
                separates the date from the time while 'Z' indicates that the time is set to UTC.</p>

            <p><a name="linkedDataDef"></a><strong>Linked Data</strong>: A set of design principles first articulated
                by Tim Berners-Lee for discovering, connecting, and sharing structured data over the Web. The principles
                can be summarized as follows: use <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> as names for things;
                use HTTP <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> so that information about things (e.g., people,
                objects, concepts) can be retrieved using a standard format; link out to other relevant things by way of
                their <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a>/<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> in order to promote discovery of new relationships
                between things.</p>

            <p><a name="lisDef"></a><strong>LIS</strong>: Learning Information Services&reg; (LIS&reg;) [[!LIS-20]] is an
                IMS standard that defines how systems manage the exchange of information that describes people, groups,
                memberships, courses and outcomes.</p>

            <p><a name="ltiDef"></a><strong>LTI</strong>: Learning Tools Interoperability&reg; (LTI&reg;) [[!LTI-13]] is an
                IMS standard for integration of rich learning applications within educational environments.</p>

            <p><a name="profileDef"></a><strong>Profile</strong>: models a learning activity or a supporting
                activity that helps facilitate learning.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts
                that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent
                manner using a shared vocabulary.</p>

            <p><a name="objectDef"></a><strong>Object</strong>: an <a href="#entity">Entity</a> that an
                <a href="#agent">Agent</a> interacts with that becomes the focus, target or object of an interaction.
                A Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> includes an <code>object</code> attribute for representing the
                resource.</p>

            <p><a name="sensorDef"></a><strong>Sensor</strong>: Software assets deployed within a learning application that
                implement the <a href="#sensorAPIDef">Sensor API&trade;</a> for marshalling and transmitting Caliper data to
                a target endpoint.</p>

            <p><a name="sensorAPIDef"></a><strong>Sensor API&trade;</strong>: The standard set of methods and supported
                parameters that a <a href="#sensorDef">Sensor</a> implements according to this specification in order
                to transmit Caliper data in an interoperable way.</p>

            <p><a name="termDef"></a><strong>Term</strong>: a word or short expression that expands to an
                <a href="#iriDef">IRI</a> when mapped to a JSON-LD <a href="#contextDef">context</a> document. Terms are
                employed by Caliper as <code>type</code> property string values in order to distinguish between various
                JSON representations of entities and events defined by the Caliper information model.</p>

            <p><a name="typeCoercionDef"></a><strong>Type Coercion</strong>: the process of coercing values to a particular
                data type.</p>

            <p><a name="uriDef"></a><strong>URI</strong>:  the Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="#uriDef">URI</a>)
                utilizes the US-ASCII character set to identify a resource. Per <a href="#rfc2396">RFC 2396</a> a
                <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> "can be further classified as a locator, a name or both."  Both the Uniform
                Resource Locator (<a href="#urlDef">URL</a>) and the Uniform Resource Name (<a href="#urnDef">URN</a>)
                are considered subspaces of the more general <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> space.

            <p><a name="urlDef"></a><strong>URL</strong>: A Uniform Resource Locator (<a href="#urlDef">URL</a>) is a
                type of <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> that provides a reference to resource that specifies both its location
                and a means of retrieving a representation of it.  An HTTP <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> is a
                <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> and using HTTP <a href="#iriDef">IRIs</a> /<a href="#uriDef">URIs</a> to identify
                things is fundamental to <a href="#linkedData">Linked Data</a>.</p>

            <p><a name="urnDef"></a><strong>URN</strong>: A Uniform Resource Name (<a href="#urnDef">URN</a>) is a type
                of <a href="#uriDef">URI</a> that provides a persistent identifier for a resource that is bound to a
                defined namespace.  Unlike a <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> is location-independent
                and provides no means of accessing a representation of the named resource.</p>

            <p><a name="uuidDef"></a><strong>UUID</strong>: a 128-bit identifier that does not require a registration
                authority to assure uniqueness. However, absolute uniqueness is not guaranteed although the collision
                probability is considered extremely low. Caliper recommends use of randomly or pseudo-randomly
                generated version 4 UUIDs. Each Caliper <a href="#event">Event</a> MUST be assigned a UUID that is
                expressed as a <a href="#urnDef">URN</a> using the form <code>urn:uuid:&lt;UUID&gt;</code> as described in
                <a href="#rfc4122">RFC 4122</a>.

        <p>The Caliper information model defines a number of profiles, each of which models a learning activity or a
            supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  A profile's <em>raison d'etre</em> is to encourage vocabulary
            standardization and re-use among application providers delivering complementary, albeit competing capabilities
            that collect learning activity data.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that
            application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner
            using a shared vocabulary.  Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment
            submission represent a few examples of the many activities or events that Caliper's profiles attempt to
            describe.</p>

        <p>
            Think of each profile as a stand-alone, logical container, or collection of one or more Caliper events
            that together help describe a set of inter-related activities.  Each <a href="#Event">Event</a> type included in a
            profile place constraints on the various entities and actions that can be utilized to describe a
            learning activity. Vocabulary restrictions are outlined in each profile description under the following
            headings:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>supported events</li>
            <li>supported actors</li>
            <li>supported actions</li>
            <li>supported objects</li>
            <li>supported target entities</li>
            <li>supported generated entities</li>
            <li>other requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As an example, the <a href="#ForumProfile">Forum Profile</a> models a set of activities associated
            with online discussions involving instructors and learners. The profile currently includes a
            <a href="#ForumEvent">ForumEvent</a>, <a href="#MessageEvent">MessageEvent</a>,
            <a href="#NavigationEvent">NavigationEvent</a>, <a href="#ThreadEvent">ThreadEvent</a> and
            <a href="#ViewEvent">ViewEvent</a>. An action sequence mediated by the
            <a href="#ForumProfile">Forum Profile</a> might involve a learner navigating to a forum, subscribing
            to it, viewing a thread, posting a message in reply to an earlier post and then marking the message as
            read.</p>

        <p>
            Extending Caliper's information model involves designing a new profile or enhancing an existing one.
            Implementers are free to implement only those Caliper profiles as are necessary to model a learning
            domain. A video platform provider may decide that only the
            <a href="#AssignableProfile">Assignable Profile</a>, <a href="#MediaProfile">Media Profile</a> and
            <a href="#SessionProfile">Session Profile</a> are relevant to its needs, while developers instrumenting
            an assessment engine would most likely implement the <a href="#AssessmentProfile">Assessment Profile</a>,
            <a href="#GradingProfile">Grading Profile</a> and <a href="#SessionProfile">Session Profile</a>.</p>

        <p>Caliper 1.2 includes the following profiles which are summarized individually below:</p>

        <p>
            <a href="#AnnotationProfile">Annotation Profile</a>,
            <a href="#AssessmentProfile">Assessment Profile</a>,
            <a href="#AssignableProfile">Assignable Profile</a>,

        <h2>Actions</h2>

        <p>Caliper includes a vocabulary of actions for describing learning interactions. Each action <a href="#termDef">Term</a>
            is based on the past-tense form of an English (en-US) verb.  An action <a href="#termDef">Term</a> can also indicate a
            change in a particular characteristic of the <code>object</code> (e.g., resolution, size, speed, volume).
            Each action <a href="#termDef">Term</a> is mapped to a persistent <a href="iriDef">IRI</a> listed in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD
            <a href="http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p2">context</a>.  Each action is also linked to a brief definition
            ("gloss") derived in whole or in part from Princeton University's WordNet&reg; project in order to eliminate
            ambiguity and aid natural language processing.</p>

        <p>Each Caliper <a href="#Event">Event</a> type supports one or more of the actions listed below.
            The <a href="#Event">Event</a> <code>action</code> property string value MUST be set to the appropriate
            <a href="termDef">Term</a>. Only one action may be specified per <a href="#Event">Event</a>.</p>
