<p>The Caliper Reading Profile models activities associated with navigating to and viewing digital textual
    content. Caliper provides a number of entities representing digital content including a generic
    <a href="#DigitalResource">DigitalResource</a> and
    <a href="#DigitalResourceCollection">DigitalResourceCollection</a> along with
    <a href="#Document">Document</a>, <a href="#Chapter">Chapter</a>, <a href="#Page">Page</a>,
    <a href="#WebPage">WebPage</a>, <a href="#Message">Message</a> and <a href="#Frame">Frame</a>.</p>

<p>The Reading Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know when assigned course content is first accessed by my students.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know what materials are being accessed.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know how often is the content viewed.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know what paths are taken to reach the content.</li>
</ul>

<p>When used in conjunction with the Assessment Profile viewing patterns can be correlated to performance measures.</p>

<p>The Reading Profile defines a <a href="#NavigationEvent">NavigationEvent</a> for traversing resources and a
    <a href="#ViewEvent">ViewEvent</a> for viewing content. A <a href="#Frame">Frame</a> MAY be specified as the
    <code>target</code> in order to indicate an indexed segment or location.</p>
