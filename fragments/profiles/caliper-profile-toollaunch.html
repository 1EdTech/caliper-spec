<p>The Caliper Tool Launch Profile is intended to capture the utilization of learning tools from a centralized location,
    such as an LTI Tool Platform (often an LMS). As such, it is distinct from the Caliper
    <a href="#profile-tooluse">Tool Use Profile</a>, also defined in this specification, which captures tool usage as
    reported by the individual tools themselves (i.e. decentralized capture).</p>

<p>The Tool Launch and Tool Use Profiles have their own unique set of advantages; the primary advantage of the Tool
    Launch Profile is that it only requires a single sensor to be deployed (typically in an LMS), whereas the Tool Use
    Profile requires all tools being measured to implement the Caliper sensor API.</p>

<p>Data captured using the Tool Launch Profile can be used to determine which tools were launched within a given
    timeframe, by whom and in what context. However, it can not, as opposed to the Tool Use Profile, provide
    a measure of whether the user actually interacted with the tool in a manner that the application determines to be
    its “intended use for learning”.</p>

<p>In certain deployment contexts, using both the Tool Launch and the Tool Use Profiles may be advantageous, as, for
    example, it allows the tracking of the number of tool launches that do <em>not</em> lead to interactions
    corresponding to the "intended use for learning".</p>

<p>The Tool Launch Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an instructor, I would like to know which of the available tools are launched the most and the least.</li>
    <li>As an administrator, I would like to know which of the available tools signal workflow completion with an
        explicit return.</li>
    <li>As an administrator, I would like to know which courses utilize certain tools the most and the least.</li>
    <li>As a researcher, I would like to know if there are demographic variances in the utilization of the available
        tools.</li>
    <li>As a researcher, I would like to know if there are temporal variances in the utilization of the available
        tools.</li>
</ul>
