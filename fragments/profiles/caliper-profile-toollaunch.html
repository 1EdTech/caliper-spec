<p>The Caliper Tool Launch Profile is intended to capture the utilization of learning tools from a centralized location,
    such as an LTI Tool Platform (often an LMS). As such, it is distinct from the Caliper
    <a href="#profile-tooluse">Tool Use Profile</a>, also defined in this specification, which captures tool usage as
    reported by the individual tools themselves (i.e. decentralized capture).</p>

<p>The Tool Launch and Tool Use Profiles have their own unique set of advantages; the primary advantage of the Tool
    Launch Profile is that it only requires a single sensor to be deployed (typically in an LMS), whereas the Tool Use
    Profile requires all tools being measured to implement the Caliper sensor API.</p>

<p>The Tool Launch Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an administrator,
        <ul>
            <li>I would like to know what student data is being passed to LTI tools.</li>
            <li>I would like to know which tools are launched the most and the least.</li>
            <li>I would like to know which courses utilize certain tools the most and the least.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>As a researcher,
        <ul>
            <li>I would like to know if Caliper event data combined with demographic data reveals
                demographic variances in the utilization of the available tools.</li>
            <li>I would like to know if there are temporal variances in the utilization of the
                available tools.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<aside class="example" title='Tool Launch data'>
    <p>Data captured using the Tool Launch Profile can be used to determine which tools were
        launched within a given time frame, by whom and in what context. However, it can not, as
        opposed to the <a href="#profile-tooluse">Tool Use Profile</a>, provide a measure of
        whether the user actually interacted with the tool in a manner that the application
        determines to be its “intended use for learning”.</p>

    <p>In certain deployment contexts, using both the Tool Launch Profile and the
        <a href="#profile-tooluse">Tool Use Profile</a> may be advantageous, as, for example, it
        allows the tracking of the number of tool launches that do <em>not</em> lead to interactions
        corresponding to the "intended use for learning".</p>
</aside>

<p>The Tool Launch Profile defines a <a href="#ToolLaunchEvent">ToolLaunchEvent</a> for describing a
    <a href="#Person">Person</a> launching a tool from a platform or returning to a platform after completing a
    tool session. Two actions are described:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Event</th>
            <th>actor</th>
            <th>action</th>
            <th>object</th>
            <th>generated</th>
            <th>target</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="#ToolLaunchEvent">ToolLaunchEvent</a></td>
            <td><a href="#Person">Person</a></td>
            <td><a href="#action-launched">Launched</a></td>
            <td><a href="#softwareapplication">SoftwareApplication</a></td>
            <td><a href="#digitalresource">DigitalResource</a></td>
            <td><a href="#Link">Link</a> | <a href="#LtiLink">LtiLink</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="#ToolLaunchEvent">ToolLaunchEvent</a></td>
            <td><a href="#Person">Person</a></td>
            <td><a href="#action-returned">Returned</a></td>
            <td><a href="#softwareapplication">SoftwareApplication</a></td>
            <td><a href="#digitalresource">DigitalResource</a></td>
            <td><a href="#Link">Link</a> | <a href="#LtiLink">LtiLink</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

When constructing a <a href="#ToolLaunchEvent">TooLaunchEvent</a> governed by the Tool Launch Profile the following
rules and recommendations apply:

<ul>
    <li>The properties <code>id</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>actor</code>, <code>action</code>,
        <code>object</code>, and <code>eventTime</code> are required and MUST be referenced.</li>
    <li>Although optional, the governing <code>profile</code> SHOULD also be specified.</li>
    <li>Likewise, if activity context data is available and relevant the optional properties <code>generated</code>,
        <code>edApp</code>, <code>group</code>, <code>membership</code>, <code>target</code>, <code>referrer</code>,
        and <code>session</code> SHOULD be referenced.</li>
    <li>A <code>generated</code> <a href="#digitalresource">DigitalResource</a> or, more likely,
        one of its specific subtypes MAY be expressed if the workflow includes a resource intended for the receiver of
        the workflow message associated with this event (for example, a file, or image, or LTI resource link for the
        receiver to embed within its system).</li>
    <li>For a <a href="#launched">Launched</a> action a <code>target</code> MAY be specified to record the fully
        qualified entry-point <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> on the external tool to which the platform launches.</li>
    <li>For a <a href="#action-returned">Returned</a> action a <code>target</code> MAY be specified to record the fully
        qualified entry-point <a href="#urlDef">URL</a> on the platform to which the tool is redirecting the
        workflow after user activity from the original launch finishes (this could be the
        <code>launch_presentation_return_url</code> in the case of a simple LTI Resource Link request; it could also
        be the <code>deep_link_return_url</code> in the case of a Deep Linking Response message).</li>
    <li>For a <a href="#launched">Launched</a> action, the <code>federatedSession</code> MUST be referenced. Workflows
        that include a specific "return message" component (e.g. LTI Deep Linking response messages)
        SHOULD provide the <code>federatedSession</code> and SHOULD populate its <code>messageParameters</code>
        property with the message parameters in the response message.</li>
    <li>A map of additional <code>extensions</code> MAY be included but beware the inherent interoperability
        limitations of transmitting data not described by the model.</li>
</ul>
