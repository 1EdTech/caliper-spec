<p>The Caliper Survey Profile provides a vocabulary for describing events associated with a respondent's
    participation in online surveys. A key use case involves instrumenting platforms that provide online surveys
    that explore the student learning experience, student engagement, learning activities, learning progress,
    and learning performance. The profile models a <a href="#Person">Person</a>, typically a respondent or a rater,
    participating in a survey in order to provide feedback on their learning and academic experiences.</p>

<p>Everyone learns differently with a mix of their own learning styles. It is also known that a student’s
    time spent on online learning activities does not necessarily indicate that the student finds the materials easy
    or hard, interesting or boring, useful or not to their learning. Student feedback is a key source of data that can
    help glean insights into students’ learning styles and interests, as well as areas to improve. In that sense,
    student feedback data adds an additional dimension of students’ behavioral data for learning analytics, such as
    learning about student perceptions of how effectively activities helped student learning and what specific
    areas in teaching and learning can be improved to enhance students’ learning experience and performance.
    The Caliper Survey Profile expands the pool of Caliper-instrumented learning data profiles to enhance the learning
    analytics across the analytics continuum &mdash; descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive &mdash; by
    allowing to incorporate student voices to make learning analytics more robust.</p>

<p>The Survey Profile supports the following user stories: (...TO DO  Compare user stories to bulleted list from
    standalone profile; each story was derived from one bullet in the list; order has been maintained.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an instructor, I would like to analyze survey response rates and responses to gauge the engagement level of
        my students.</li>
    <li>As a researcher, I would like to assess whether student feedback on learning experiences can help create
        predictive models &mdash; in combination with behavioral data, demographics, and performance &mdash; for
        student retention and success.
    <li>As an instructor, I would like to use student feedback to determine the efficacy of personalized or
        adaptive learning interventions and to help design new learning plans and strategies with these methods.
    <li>As an instructor, I would like to analyze student feedback to find ways to measure the effectiveness of  my
        teaching, assess student progress, and identify areas for corrective intervention.
    <li>As an administrator, I would like to use responses to survey questions concerning workload in combination with
        other behavioral data to determine whether workloads are set to optimize learning.
    <li>As a researcher, I would like to monitor and analyze survey response rates and patterns to ensure the
        reliability and validity of the data collected, as well as to inform future collection methods.</li>
