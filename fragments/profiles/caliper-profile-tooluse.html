<p>The Caliper Tool Use Profile models an intended interaction between a user and a tool. In other words,
    when a <code>Person</code> utilizes a <code>SoftwareApplication</code> in a manner that the application
    determines to be its intended use for learning, an application that implements the Tool Use Profile
    can emit a <code>ToolUseEvent</code> indicating such usage.</p>

<p>The Tool Use Profile enables the gathering of basic usage information. It provides an easy way to get
    started with a base level of instrumentation by allowing the learning tool to make the determination
    of its own use. Any learning app can be instrumented using this profile to detect when a learner
    accesses the tool and uses it in the way it was intended.</p>

<p>The Tool Use Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know what tools are being used, and how often.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know who are the most active and least active users of tools.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know whether or not tool usage helps or hinders student performance.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know which tools have the greatest impact on student performance.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know how much time learners are spending using a tool.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to know how much curricular progress learners have made in a tool.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I want to be able to view my students' "time on task" across multiple learning
        tools using a dashboard powered by a Caliper event store.</li>
    <li>As a data scientist, I want to be able to study the impact of a student's curricular progress in a
        learning tool on his or her academic achievement.</li>
    <li>As a student, I want to confirm that the progress and time metrics I see in a learning tool matches
        the metrics I see in an aggregated dashboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tool Use Profile defines a <a href="#ToolUseEvent">ToolUseEvent</a> for describing a
    <a href="#Person">Person</a> using a learning tool in a way that the tool's creators have
    determined is an indication of a learning interaction. A <a href="#ToolUseEvent">ToolUseEvent</a>
    MAY reference a generated <a href="#AggregateMeasureCollection">AggregateMeasureCollection</a>
    containing one or more <a href="#entity-aggregateMeasure">AggregateMeasure</a> entities that
    provide information on a learner's "progress" using the tool. The following metrics can be recorded:
    <a href="#metric-assessmentpassed">AssessmentPassed</a>,
    <a href="#metric-assessmentsubmitted">AssessmentSubmitted</a>,
    <a href="#metric-minutesontask">MinutesOnTask</a>,
    <a href="#metric-skillsmastered">SkillsMastered</a>,
    <a href="#metric-standardsmastered">StandardsMastered</a>,
    <a href="#metric-unitscompleted">UnitsCompleted</a></li>,
    <a href="#metric-unitspassed">UnitsPassed</a>,
    <a href="#metric-wordsread">WordsRead</a>.</p>
