<p>The Caliper Annotation Profile models activities related to the annotation of a
    <a href="#digitalResource">DigitalResource</a>. Creating a bookmark, highlighting selected text,
    sharing a resource, tagging a document, and viewing an annotation are modeled. The generated
    <a href="#annotation">Annotation</a> is also described and is subtyped for greater type specificity.</p>

<p>The Annotation Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know which students are generating annotations.</li>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know what content is most often annotated.</li>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know what types of annotations are being created.</li>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know which segments of text are being highlighted.</li>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know what tags are being used.</li>
    <li>As an instructor I would like to know what notes are being added.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, instructors can use the places where students are making notes in the course material
    to determine whether they have the right idea about which material should be highlighted. In addition,
    if there are students who are asking questions or making notes indicating confusion about a particular
    piece of content, this can also inform the instructor about the suitability or quality of the material
    which they have chosen to use.</p>

<p>The Annotation Profile defines an <a href="#AnnotationEvent">AnnotationEvent</a> for describing the
    annotation of resources. For each <a href="#AnnotationEvent">AnnotationEvent</a> described,
    the governing <code>profile</code> SHOULD be referenced (e.g., "AnnotationProfile"). Additionally, the
    <code>generated</code> <a href="#Annotation">Annotation</a> subtype SHOULD be specified.
    Pair the <code>action</code> with the appropriate <a href="#Annotation">Annotation</a>
    subtype (e.g., <a href="#action-bookmarked">Bookmarked</a> with
    <a href="#BookmarkAnnotation">BookmarkAnnotation</a>). If the <code>generated</code>
    <a href="#Annotation">Annotation</a> is expressed as an object both the
    <code>annotator</code> and <code>annotated</code> entities SHOULD be referenced.</p>
