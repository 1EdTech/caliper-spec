<p>The Caliper Search Profile models an <code>actor</code>, typically a learner, querying a resource for information.
    The profile provides a <a href="#SearchEvent">SearchEvent</a> and a <a href="#action-searched">Searched</a> action
    for describing information retrieval activities. An optional <a href="#SearchResponse">SearchResponse</a>
    entity can be employed to describe the <a href="#Query">Query</a> submitted by a user as well as any
    <code>searchResults</code> returned as a result of the search.</p>

<p>When the Search Profile is used in conjunction with the <a href="#profile-reading">Reading Profile</a>, a learner's
    navigation, search, and viewing behavior can be combined to provide a richer picture of learner interactions with
    digital resources.</p>

<p>The Search Profile supports the following user stories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>As a librarian, I would like to know the frequency of searches conducted and the resources queried.</li>
    <li>As an instructor, I would like to know how students designed and used structured queries.</li>
    <li>As a student, I would like to have a record of the topics I searched and the query terms I employed.</li>
</ul>
