# IMS Global caliper-common-fixtures

The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning 
activity data at scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface 
(the Sensor API™) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented 
applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  

caliper-common-fixtures provides a set of unit test fixtures for
[Caliper](http://www.imsglobal.org/caliper) SensorAPI™ reference
implementations to test against.

You can find the test fixtures for each Caliper release in a corresponding top
level directory (for example, you can find the Caliper v1.1 fixtures in the
top-level `v1p1` sub-directory).
