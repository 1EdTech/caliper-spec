# Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification

The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](./caliper-spec.md) provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data.  Establishing a common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.

Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.

The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](./caliper-spec.md) is written using [Github-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM), a dialect of Markdown that provides a lightweight  markup language for structuring plain-text documents.
