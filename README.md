The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning 
activity data at scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface 
(the Sensor API™) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented 
applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  

*caliper-common-fixtures* provides a set of unit test fixtures for 
[Caliper](http://www.imsglobal.org/caliper) SensorAPI™ reference implementations 
to test against.
