## 1.0. Introduction
Delivering teaching and learning at scale is encouraging adoption of “big data” practices.  Cloud computing and machine learning are changing both the learning technology landscape and the business of education.  The definition of what constitutes learning is also evolving beyond the formal classroom experience to include informal, social and experiential modes of acquiring knowledge and skills.  Opportunities exist to leverage new tools, tap new data sources, ask new questions and pursue new insights. 

Consider the enterprising instructor seeking to augment if not transform the classroom environment for her students.  She utilizes a video platform to create and post video assignments.  Class discussions and Q&A sessions are conducted online using another service.  She administers her course using a learning management system.  Three services, three vendors, three potential sources of data.  

Analyzing the viewing behavior of her students in relation to the questions they pose about her course content is vital to understanding student comprehension and performance.  Yet exploring such relationships is all too often a challenging exercise.  Likely there are significant barriers to overcome.  Is the data required for analysis actually collected?  If it exists, who owns it?  If ownership is not an issue what about privacy concerns?  If privacy protocols are in place is the data easy to retrieve?  If retrievable how difficult is it to combine data sourced from multiple platforms?

The Caliper Analytics® specification seeks to address a number of the issues outlined above by providing a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data.  Establishing a common vocabulary for describing learning interactions is a central objective.  Promoting data interoperability, data sharing and data-informed decision making are also important goals.

Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  Industry-wide adoption of Caliper offers the tantalizing prospect of a more unified learning data environment in which to build new and innovative services designed to measure, infer, predict, report and visualize.

<a name="conventions" />

### 1.1 Conventions
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](#rfc2119).  A Sensor implementation that fails to implement a MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL requirement or fails to abide by a MUST NOT/SHALL NOT prohibition is considered nonconformant.  SHOULD/SHOULD NOT/RECOMMENDED statements constitute a best practice.  Ignoring a best practice does not violate conformance but a decision to disregard such guidance should be carefully considered.  MAY/OPTIONAL statements indicate that implementors are entirely free to choose whether or not to implement the option.

<a name="terminology" />

### 1.2 Terminology

<a name="actorDef" />

__Actor__: An actor is an [Agent](#agent) capable of initiating or performing an [action](#actionDef) on a thing or as part of a process.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `actor` attribute for representing the [Agent](#agent). 

<a name="blankNodeDef" />

__Blank Node Identifier__: a string that begins with "_:" that is used to identify an [Entity](#entity) for which an [IRI](#iriDef) is not provided.  An [Entity](#entity) provisioned with a blank node identifier is neither dereferenceable nor has meaning outside the scope of the [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document within which it resides.

<a name="actionDef" />

__Action__: something performed or done to accomplish a purpose.  Caliper [Event](#event) subtypes define a controlled vocabulary of one or more [actions](#actions) relevant to the activity domain.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `action` attribute for expressing the associated action.     

<a name="contextDef" />

__Context__: a special [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) keyword that maps the terms employed in a JSON document to [IRIs](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt) that link to one or more published vocabularies.  Inclusion of a [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/) context provides an economical way of communicating document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event data.

<a name="endpointDef" />

__Endpoint__: a receiver or consumer of Caliper data that is bound to a specific network protocol.  

<a name="entityDef" />

__Entity__: an object or a thing that participates in learning-related activity.  Caliper [Entity](#entity) types provide course-grained representations of applications, people, groups and resources that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper [Event](#event).  Each [Entity](#entity) corresponds to a node in a directed graph.

<a name="eventDef" />

__Event__: describes a relationship established between an [Agent](#agent) (the `actor`) and an [Entity](#entity) (the `object`) formed as a result of a purposeful `action` undertaken by the `actor` in connection to the `object` at a particular moment in time.

<a name="jsonldDef" />

__JSON-LD__: a specification providing a JSON-based data serialization and messaging format, processing algorithms and API for working with [Linked Data](#linkedData).  The messages described in this specification are intended to be used in programming environments that support [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/).

<a name="iriDef" />

__IRI__: The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) extends the Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI](#uriDef)) scheme by using characters drawn from the Universal character set rather than US-ASCII per [RFC 3987](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).  [Linked Data](#linkedData) rely on IRIs to refer to most nodes and properties.

<a name="iso8601Def" /> 

__ISO 8601__: Caliper data and time values are formatted per ISO 8601 with the addition of millisecond precision.  The format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ where 'T' separates the date from the time while 'Z' indicates that the time is set to UTC.

<a name="linkedDataDef" /> 
 
__Linked Data__: A set of design principles first articulated by Tim Berners-Lee for discovering, connecting, and sharing structured data over the Web.  The principles can be summarized as follows: use [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) as names for things; use HTTP [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) so that information about things (e.g., people, objects, concepts) can be retrieved using a standard format; link out to other relevant things by way of their [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDef) in order to promote discovery of new relationships between things.
 
<a name="ltiDef" />
 
__LTI__: Learning Tools Interoperability&reg; (LTI&reg;) is an IMS standard for integration of rich learning applications within educational environments.

<a name="metricProfileDef" />

__Metric Profile__: models a learning activity or a supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner using a shared vocabulary.

<a name="objectDef" />
 
__Object__: an [Entity](#entity) that an [Agent](#agent) interacts with that becomes the focus, target or object of an interaction.  A Caliper [Event](#event) includes an `object` attribute for representing the resource.

<a name="sensorDef" />

__Sensor__: Software assets deployed within a learning application for marshalling and transmitting Caliper data to a target endpoint.

<a name="termDef" />

__Term__: a word or short expression that expands to an [IRI](#iriDef) when mapped to a JSON-LD [context](#contextDef) document. Terms are employed by Caliper as `type` property string values in order to distinguish between various JSON representations of entities and events defined by the Caliper information model.

<a name="typeCoercionDef" />

__Type Coercion__: the process of coercing values to a particular data type.

<a name="uriDef" />

__URI__:  the Uniform Resource Identifier ([URI](#uriDef)) utilizes the US-ASCII character set to identify a resource.  Per [RFC 2396](#rfc2396) a [URI](#uriDef) "can be further classified as a locator, a name or both."  Both the Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](#urlDef)) and the Uniform Resource Name ([URN](#urnDef)) are considered subspaces of the more general [URI](#uriDef) space. 

<a name="urlDef" />
 
__URL__: A Uniform Resource Locator ([URL](#urlDef)) is a type of [URI](#uriDef) that provides a reference to resource that specifies both its location and a means of retrieving a representation of it.  An HTTP [URI](#uriDef) is a [URL](#urlDef) and using HTTP IRIs/URIs to identify things is fundamental to Linked Data.

<a name="urnDef" />

__URN__: A Uniform Resource Name ([URN](#urnDef)) is a type of [URI](#uriDef) that provides a persistent identifier for a resource that is bound to a defined namespace.  Unlike a [URL](#urlDef) a [URN](#urnDef) is location-independent and provides no means of accessing a representation of the named resource.  

<a name="uuidDef" />

__UUID__: a 128-bit identifier that does not require a registration authority to assure uniqueness.  However, absolute uniqueness is not guaranteed although the collision probability is considered extremely low. Caliper recommends use of randomly or pseudo-randomly generated version 4 UUIDs.  Each Caliper [Event](#event) MUST be assigned a UUID that is expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` as described in [RFC 4122](#rfc4122).


<a name="infoModel" />

## 2.0 The Information Model 

The Caliper information model defines a set of concepts, rules, and relationships for describing learning activities.  Each activity domain modeled is described in a [Metric Profile](#infoModelProfiles) ("profile").  Each profile is composed of one or more [Event](#event) types.  Each [Event](#event) defines a controlled vocabulary of [actions](#actions) undertaken by learners, instructors, and others, that are scoped to the event.  Various [Entity](#entity) types representing people, groups, and resources are provided in order to better describe both the relationships established between participating entities and the contextual elements relevant to the interaction.

<a name="infoModelEvent" />

### 2.1 The Caliper Event
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Event Model" src="assets/caliper-event_model_no_title-v3.png"></div>

A Caliper [Event](#event) ("event") is a generic type that describes the relationship established between an `actor` and an `object`, formed as a result of a purposeful [action](#actions) undertaken by the `actor` in connection to the `object` at a particular moment in time and (optionally) within a given context.  The [Event](#event) properties `actor`, `action` and `object` form a compact data structure that resembles an [RDF](#rdf) triple linking a subject to an object via a predicate.  A learner starting an assessment, annotating a reading, pausing a video, or posting a message to a forum, are examples of learning activities that Caliper models as events.

Caliper defines a number of [Event](#event) subtypes, each scoped to a particular activity domain and distinguishable via a `type` property.  Each [Event](#event) instance can be referenced by its unique identifier.  The `type` value is a string that MUST match the term specified for the [Event](#event) by the Caliper information model (e.g. "MessageEvent").  The assigned `id` value MUST be a string representation of a [UUID](#uuidDef) as a [URN](#urnDef) per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122) which describes a [URN](#urnDef) namespace for [UUIDs](#uuidDef).  

The information model also seeks to describe the learning environment or context in which a learning activity is situated.  Group affiliation, membership roles, and status, recent navigation history, supporting technology and session information can all be optionally represented.  An [Entity](#entity) generated as a result of the interaction between an `actor` and an `object` can also be described; annotating a piece of digital content and producing an [Annotation](#annotation) is one such example.  An `extensions` property is also provided so that implementors can add custom properties not described by the model.  

Considered as a data structure an [Event](#event) constitutes an unordered set of key:value pairs that is semi-structured by design.  Optional attributes can be ignored when describing an [Event](#event).  An [Entity](#entity) participating in an [Event](#event) can be represented as an object or as a string that corresponds to the [IRI](#iriDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity).

#### Properties
The base set of [Event](#event) properties or attributes is listed below.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  The `id`, `type`, `actor`, `action`, `object` and `eventTime` properties are required; all other properties are optional.  Custom properties not described by the model MAY be included, but MUST be added to the `extensions` property as an array of object values.  Properties with a value of *null* or empty SHOULD be excluded prior to serialization.

| Property | Type | Description | Conformance |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [UUID](#uuidDef) | The emitting application MUST provision the [Event](#event) with a [UUID](#uuidDef).  A version 4 [UUID](#uuidDef) SHOULD be generated.  The UUID MUST be expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122). | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Event](#event) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document MUST be specified.  For a generic [Event](#event) set the `type` to the string value *Event*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the `type` to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *NavigationEvent*. | Required |
| actor | [Agent](#agent) | The [Agent](#agent) who initiated the [Event](#event), typically a [Person](#person), [Organization](#organization) or [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication), MUST be specified.  The `actor` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the actor's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| action | [Term](#termDef) | The action or predicate that binds the actor or subject to the object MUST be specified.  The `action` range is limited to the set of [actions](#actions) described in this specification and may be further constrained by the chosen [Event](#event) type.  Only one `action` [Term](#termDef) may be specified per [Event](#event). | Required |
| object | [Entity](#entity) | The [Entity](#entity) that comprises the object of the interaction MUST be specified.  The `object` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the object's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |

| target | [Entity](#entity) | An [Entity](#entity) that represents a particular segment or location within the `object`.  The `target` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the target entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| generated | [Entity](#entity) | An [Entity](#entity) created or generated as a result of the interaction.  The `generated` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the generated entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| edApp | [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) | A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) that constitutes the application context MAY be specified.  The `edApp` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the edApp's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| referrer | [Entity](#entity)  | An [Entity](#entity) that represents the referring context MAY be specified. A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) or [DigitalResource](#digitalResource) will typically constitute the referring context.  The `referrer` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the referrer's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| group | [Organization](#organization) | An [Organization](#organization) that represents the group context MAY be specified.  The `group` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the group's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| membership | [Membership](#membership) | The relationship between the `actor` and the `group` in terms of roles assigned and current status MAY be specified.  The `membership` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the membership entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| session | [Session](#session) | The current user [Session](#session) MAY be specified.  The `session` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the session's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional | 
| federatedSession | [LtiSession](#ltiSession) | If the [Event](#event) occurs within the context of an [LTI](#lti) tool launch, the actor's tool consumer [LtiSession](#ltiSession) MAY be referenced.  The `federatedSession` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the federatedSession's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| extensions | Array | An ordered collection of objects not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Event](#event). | Optional |

<a name="infoModelEntity" />

### 2.2 The Caliper Entity
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Caliper Entities" src="assets/caliper-entities-v2.png"></div>

A Caliper [Entity](#entity) is a generic type that represents objects that participate in learning-related activities.  A number of [Entity](#entity) subtypes have been defined in order to better describe people, groups, organizations, digital content, courses, software applications, and other objects that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper [Event](#event).  Each [Entity](#entity) is provisioned with a modest set of properties or attributes that support discovery and description.

Like an [Event](#event), an [Entity](#entity) is considered semi-structured data consisting of an unordered set of key:value pairs.  Optional attributes need not be referenced when describing an [Entity](#entity).  When referenced in a Caliper [Event](#infoModelEvent) an [Entity](#entity) can be represented as an object or as a string.

If an object representation is provided, both the type and identifier of the [Entity](#entity) MUST be specified.  Each [Entity](#entity) is provisioned with `type` and `id` properties.  The `type` value is a string that MUST match the term specified for the [Entity](#entity) by the Caliper information model (e.g. "Person").  The `id` value is a string that MUST be expressed as an [IRI](#iriDef).  The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be valid and unique.  The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD also be dereferenceable, i.e., capable of returning a representation of the resource assuming authorization to access the resource is granted.  A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided although care should be taken when employing a location-independent identifier since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it to retrieve machine-readable data. 

Other [Entity](#entity) properties are descriptive in nature, or link the [Entity](#entity) to other related entities.  Certain [Entity](#entity) types like [Annotation](#annotation), [DigitalResource](#digitalResource), [Message](#message) or [Organization](#organization) are provisioned with additional properties that allow for a more complete representation of the object.  An `extensions` property is also defined so that implementors can add custom properties not described by the model.  Optional attributes can be ignored when describing an [Entity](#entity).    

If a string representation is provided the value MUST correspond to the [IRI](#iriDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity).

#### Properties
The base set of [Entity](#entity) properties is listed below.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  When representing an [Entity](#entity) as an object the `id` and `type` properties are required; all other properties are optional.  Custom properties not described by the model MAY be included but MUST be added to the `extensions` property as an array of object values.  Properties with a value of *null* or empty SHOULD be excluded prior to serialization. 

| Property | Type | Description | Conformance |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [IRI](#iriDef) | A valid [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be specified. The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be unique and persistent. The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD also be dereferenceable, i.e., capable of returning a representation of the resource. A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided in cases where a [Linked Data](#linkedDataDef) friendly HTTP URI is either unavailable or inappropriate. | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document MUST be specified.  For a generic [Entity](#entity) set the `type` value to the term *Entity*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the type to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *Person*. | Required |
| name | string | A string value comprising a word or phrase by which the [Entity](#entity) is known MAY be specified. | Optional |
| description | string |  A string value comprising a brief, written representation of the [Entity](#entity) MAY be specified. | Optional |
| dateCreated | DateTime | A date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was created MAY be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Optional |
| dateModified | DateTime | A date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was last changed or modified MAY be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Optional |
| extensions | Array | An ordered collection of objects not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Entity](#entity). | Optional |

#### Subtypes
[Agent](#agent), [Annotation](#annotation), [Assessment](#assessment), [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem), [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource), [Attempt](#attempt), [AudioObject](#audioObject), [BookmarkAnnotation](#bookmarkAnnotation), [Chapter](#chapter), [CourseOffering](#courseOffering), [CourseSection](#courseSection), [DigitalResource](#digitalResource), [DigitalResourceCollection](#digitalResourceCollection), [Document](#document), [FillinBlankResponse](#fillinBlankResponse), [Frame](#frame), [Forum](#forum), [Group](#group), [HighlightAnnotation](#highlightAnnotation), [ImageObject](#imageObject), [LearningObjective](#learningObjective), [LtiSession](#ltiSession), [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation), [MediaObject](#mediaObject), [Membership](#membership), [Message](#message), [MultipleChoiceResponse](#multipleChoiceResponse), [MultipleResponseResponse](#multipleResponseResponse), [Organization](#organization), [Page](#page), [Person](#person), [Response](#response), [Result](#result), [SelectTextResponse](#selectTextResponse), [Session](#session), [SharedAnnotation](#sharedAnnotation), [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication), [TagAnnotation](#tagAnnotation), [Thread](#thread), [TrueFalseResponse](#trueFalseResponse), [VideoObject](#videoObject), [WebPage](#webPage)

### 2.3 Metric Profiles
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Metric Profiles" src="assets/caliper-profiles-v3.png"></div>

The Caliper information model defines a number of metric profiles, each of which models a learning activity or a supporting activity that helps facilitate learning.  A metric profile's *raison d'etre* is to encourage vocabulary standardization and re-use among application providers delivering complementary, albeit competing capabilities that collect learning activity data.  Each profile provides a domain-specific set of terms and concepts that application designers and developers can draw upon to describe common user interactions in a consistent manner using a shared vocabulary.  Annotating a reading, playing a video, taking a test, or grading an assignment submission represent a few examples of the many activities or events that Caliper's metric profiles attempt to describe.
    
Think of each metric profile as a stand-alone, logical container, or collection of one or more Caliper events that together help describe a set of inter-related activities.  Each [Event](#event) included in a metric profile describes the expected entities or objects in play as well as provides a controlled vocabulary of required and optional [actions](#actions).  

As an example, the [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) models a set of activities associated with online discussions involving instructors and learners. The profile currently includes a [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent) and [ViewEvent](#viewEvent).  An action sequence mediated by the [Forum Profile](#forumProfile) might involve a learner navigating to a forum, subscribing to it, viewing a thread, posting a message in reply to an earlier post and then marking the message as read.
     
Extending Caliper's information model involves designing a new metric profile or enhancing an existing one.  Implementors are free to implement only those Caliper metric profiles as are necessary to model a learning domain.  A video platform provider may decide that only the [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Media Profile](#mediaProfile) and [Session Profile](#sessionProfile) are relevant to its needs, while developers instrumenting an assessment engine would most likely implement the [Assessment Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Grading Profile](#gradingProfile) and [Session Profile](#sessionProfile).

The following metric profiles are currently available and are summarized individually below:

[Basic Profile](#basicProfile), [Annotation Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assessment Profile](#annotationProfile), [Assignable Profile](#assignableProfile), [Forum Profile](#forumProfile), [Media Profile](#mediaProfile), [Grading Profile](#gradingProfile), [Reading Profile](#readingProfile), [Session Profile](#sessionProfile), [Tool Use Profile](#toolUseProfile)

<a name="basicProfile" />

### 2.3.1 Basic Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Basic Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_basic.png"></div>

The Caliper Basic Profile provides a generic [Event](#event) for describing learning or supporting activities that have yet to be modeled by Caliper.  Any of the Caliper [actions](#actions) described in this specification can be used to describe the interaction between the `actor` and the `object`.

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send a generic Caliper [Event](#event) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint).  At least one Caliper [action](#actions) MUST be implemented.

#### Supported Events
[Event](#event)

#### Supported Actions
All actions included in the Caliper [actions](#actions) vocabulary are supported.  However, it is RECOMMENDED that implementors look first to an existing Metric Profile that models the activity domain of interest before choosing to craft a generic [Event](#event).

#### Supported Entities
| Event | Actor |	Action | Object |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| [Event](#event) | [Agent](#agent) | [action](#actions) | [Entity](#entity) |

#### Requirements
* Certain [Event](#event) properties are required and MUST be specified.  Required properties include `id`, `type`, `actor`, `action`, `object` and `eventTime`.  All other [Event](#event) properties are considered optional and need not be referenced.  Adherence to the rules associated with each property referenced is mandatory.  
* Each [Entity](#entity) participating in the [Event](#event) MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to it's [IRI](#iriDef).
* The `action` vocabulary is limited to the supported actions described in this specification and no other.

<a name="annotationProfile" />

### 2.3.2 Annotation Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Annotation Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_annotation.png"></div>

The Caliper Annotation Profile models activities related to the annotation of a [DigitalResource](#digitalResource). Creating a bookmark, highlighting selected text, sharing a resource, tagging a document, and viewing an annotation are modeled.  The generated [Annotation](#annotation) is also described and is subtyped for greater type specificity.

As an example, instructors can use the places where students are making notes in the course material to determine whether they have the right idea about which material should be highlighted.  In addition, if there are students who are asking questions or making notes indicating confusion about a particular piece of content, this can also inform the instructor about the material which they have chosen to use.  

Questions which can be answered using this profile are as follows:

* Who is making the most annotations?
* What content is most often annotated?
* What types of annotations are applied most often?
* Are annotations being read?

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send an [AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint).  The [Bookmarked](#bookmarked) action is required and MUST be implemented.  All other supported actions are considered optional.

#### Supported Events
[AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent)

#### Supported Actions

### 2.3.3 Assessment Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Assessment Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_assessment.png"></div>

The Caliper Assessment Profile models assessment-related activities including interactions with individual assessment items. Caliper provides [Assessment](#assessment) and [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem) entities for describing the `object` of these activities, as well as a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) for recording a count of the number of times an assigned resource has been attempted.  Five [Response](#response) types are also provided for capturing individual item responses.  _Note that the Caliper 1.0 AssessmentItem Profile has been merged into the Assessment Profile._

Tracking patterns using the assessment profile will allow instructors to understand more about how students are interacting with their assessments.  Typical ways to make use of this profile are to answer the following questions:

* When are students taking assessments?
* How long do students spend on portions of individual assessments?

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send an [AssessmentEvent](#assessmentEvent) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint).  The [Started](#started) and [Submitted](#submitted) actions are required and MUST be implemented.  All other supported events and actions are considered optional.

### 2.3.4 Assignable Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Assignable Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_assignable.png"></div>

The Assignable Profile models activities associated with the assignment of digital content to a learner for completion according to specific criteria.  Caliper provides a generic [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource) for describing the `object` of these activities as well as a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) for recording a count of the number of times an assigned resource has been attempted.

This profile would be useful for instructors to gather insight about the relationship between students and their assignments.  Answers to the following questions can be enabled using this profile:

* Who is assigned what material?
* How long does it take to complete something that has been assigned?
* What piece of assigned material presents the biggest challenge (i.e. needs most retake attempts)

#### Minimum Conformance

### 2.3.6 Grading Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Grading Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_grading.png"></div>

The Caliper Grading Profile models grading activities performed by an [Agent](#agent), typically a [Person](#person) or a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication).  Grading a learner's [Attempt](#attempt) of an [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource) and generating a [Result](#result) is modeled. _Note that the Caliper 1.0 Outcomes Profile has been replaced by the Grading Profile._

The grading profile allows information to be captured about grade changes for a given assessment or submission.  This may be useful to understand the way in which students and teachers may be interacting throughout the course.  For example, the grading profile can be used to answer questions such as:

* How often are grades changed for an assessment?


#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send a Caliper [OutcomeEvent](#outcomeEvent) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint).  The [Graded](#graded) action is required and MUST be implemented.

### 2.3.7 Media Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Media Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_media.png"></div>

The Caliper Media Profile models interactions between learners and rich content such as audio, images and video.  Implementors can leverage a number of media-related entities including [AudioObject](#audioObject), [ImageObject](#audioObject) and [VideoObject](#videoObject), each subtyped from a generic [MediaObject](#mediaObject).  A [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation) entity is also provided in order to represent the current location in an audio or video stream.

As an example of how this profile could be used, consider the following scenario: an instructor has decided to incorporate a video player into their course.  The video content may or may not be launched via LTI from the Learning Management System (LMS).  Since the video player tool is instrumented to emit activity data via Caliper, the instructor will be able to collect useful information about student viewing behaviour.  In addition, he will be able to compare this data along with other relevent information in the LMS, such as assignment and quiz results.  Using data collected via Caliper, instructors (and administrators) can answer key questions, such as:
 
* Who is using the tool?
* Which videos are being played the most?
* How long are they spending on each video?
* Where do they pause the video?
* Are there instances of where students are replaying sections of the video?

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send a [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent) to a target endpoint. The [Started](#started) and [Ended](#ended) actions are required and MUST be implemented.  The [Paused](#paused), [Resumed](#resumed) and [Restarted](#restarted) actions SHOULD be implemented.  All other supported events and actions are considered optional.

### 2.3.9 Session Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Session Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_session.png"></div>

The Caliper Session Profile models the creation and subsequent termination of a user session established by a [Person](#person) interacting with a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication).  A [Session](#session) entity is described for representing the user session.

The session profile can facilitate the capture of data about who is logging into the learning environment, and more importantly, which students are not logging in.   The following are examples of the information best captured using the session profile:

* Session logins
* Which students have not logged in for more than a week
* Who logs in/logs out most/least

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send a [SessionEvent](#sessionEvent) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint). The [LoggedIn](#loggedIn) action is required and MUST be implemented.

#### Supported Events
[SessionEvent](#sessionEvent)

<a name="toolUseProfile" />

### 2.3.10 Tool Use Profile
<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Tool Use Profile" src="assets/caliper-profile_tool_use.png"></div>

The Caliper Tool Use Profile models an intended interaction between a user and a tool.  In other words, when a [Person](#person) utilizes a [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) in a manner that the application determines to be its "intended use for learning", an application that implements the Tool Use Profile can emit a [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) indicating such usage.

The Tool Use Profile enables gathering basic usage information about learning apps. This is an easy way to get started with a base level of instrumentation and letting the learning tool make the determination of its own use.   Any learning app can be instrumented through this profile to detect when a student accesses the tool and uses it in the way it was intended.   Common questions that could be answered through the use of this profile are:

* What tools are being used, and how much?
* Who is the most active/least active user of tools?
* Does tool usage help/hinder student performance?
* Which tools have the greatest impact on student performance?

#### Minimum Conformance
Create and send a Caliper [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint).  The [Used](#used) action is required and MUST be implemented.

#### Supported Events
[ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent)

#### Supported Actions
| Event | Action | WordNet® Gloss | Conformance |
| :---- | :----- | :------------- | :---------- |
| [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) | Used | [Put into service; make work or employ for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose](http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/201161188-v). | Required |

#### Supported Entities
| Event | Actor |	Action | Object |
| :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- |
| ToolUseEvent | [Person](#person) | [Used](#used) | [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) |

#### Requirements
* Certain [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) properties are required and MUST be specified.  Required properties include `id`, `type`, `actor`, `action`, `object` and `eventTime`.  All other [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) properties are considered optional and need not be referenced.  Adherence to the rules associated with each property referenced is mandatory.
* Each [Entity](#entity) participating in the [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent) MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to it's [IRI](#iriDef).
* A [Person](#person) MUST be specified as the `actor` of the interaction.
* The `action` vocabulary is limited to the supported actions described in the profile.
* A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) MUST be specified as the `object` of the interaction.

## 3.0 Serialization of the Model
Over the last decade the advent of cloud-based, networked applications have led to changes in the way data is structured and represented.  Data once considered strictly hierarchical, like a curriculum, a course roster, or a transcript now frequently link out to other kinds of data.  Modeling bundles of data pointing to other bundles of data now requires thinking in terms of graphs and [Linked Data](#linkedData).  Caliper [Event](#event) data presents us with similar structures.  A Caliper [Event](#event) can link to user data, digital content, courses and rosters, grades and credentials, institutional and organizational data, application and session data, and so on, the sources of which are likely diverse and the opportunities for discovering new relationships between the entities represented therein both numerous as well as enlightening.

Exchanging data linked to other data distributed across a wide network requires both a simple, well-understood data-interchange format as well as means of defining unambiguously the underlying semantics or meaning intended for the data structures transmitted from one machine to another.  For Caliper, [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) provides the necessary representational horsepower to both describe these kinds of data linkages and specify how data is to be understood when published and shared across a network.
  
[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) defines an economical syntax for representing learning activity data as [Linked Data](#linkedData) using [JSON](#jsonDef) as the underlying data-interchange format.  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) also provides an API and set of processing algorithms for working with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents that are based on different contexts.  Algorithms have also been developed to serialize [RDF](#rdf) as [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) and deserialize a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document to an [RDF](#rdf) data set.

<a name="jsonldContext" />

### 3.1 Context
Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents define a *context*, denoted by the `@context` keyword, a property employed to map document [Terms](#termDef) to [IRIs](#iriDef) to one or more published vocabularies.  Inclusion of a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context provides an economical way for Caliper to communicate document semantics to services interested in consuming Caliper event data.

[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) contexts can be inserted in-line or located in a file external to the document and referenced.  In the case of Caliper an external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) is available and MUST be referenced in Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents.  Each Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *describe* emitted by a [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be provisioned with a `@context` key that provides a context definition and that `@context` field MUST appear at the "top level" of the Event or Entity sent by the Sensor (in the following example, note that `@context` is a field on the Event, and not on the composed `Person` that is the `Event.actor` field's value -- that `Person` object will inherit the context mappings found in the containing event's `@context` document).

#### Example: referencing an external JSON-LD context
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "urn:uuid:3a648e68-f00d-4c08-aa59-8738e1884f2c",
  "type": "Event",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Created",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201701/courses/7/sections/1/resources/123",
    "type": "Document"
  },
  "eventTime": "2017-11-15T10:15:00.000Z"
}
```

A [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document can reference more than one context.  Additional contexts MAY be defined for a Caliper [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity) *describe* in order to ascribe meaning to terms not defined by the model.  However, Caliper-defined terms MUST NOT be overridden by additional contexts added to the document ([JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) relies on a "most-recently-defined-wins" approach when parsing duplicate terms).  Defining a context for an [Entity](#entity) that duplicates a local [Event](#event) context SHOULD be avoided.  In cases where a duplicate context exists in a Caliper [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document it SHOULD be omitted when serializing the object.  

#### Example: using multiple contexts in an Entity describe (external and in-line)
```

  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",

#### 3.1.1 Context versions
Each released version of the Caliper specification describes all the Caliper [Events](#event), [Entities](#entities), and vocabulary terms supported by that version and how they must appear for the purposes of certification and interoperability claims. The rules about the placement of the `@context` field described in the previous section mean that each [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entities) in and of itself can be entirely understood by using the version of the Caliper context referred to in the `@context` property.

Sensors SHOULD avoid sending payloads that mix versions where some [Events](#event) use one version of the Caliper context and others use another version: the receiver of a set of [Events](#event) and [Entities](#entitites) should have an expectation that they can use a single set of rules to interpret the data they have received.

Vendors that wish to support multiple versions of Caliper in production SHOULD provide a way for their customers to select one of the versions for use in their installations.

### 3.2 Identifiers
[Linked Data](#linkedData) relies on [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDefs) for the identification and retrieval of resources.  Likewise, [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) specifies the use of [IRIs](#iriDef)/[URIs](#uriDefs) for identifying most nodes (i.e., JSON objects) and their attributes.  In [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef), [IRIs](#iriDef) may be represented either as an absolute IRI containing a scheme, path and optional query and fragment segments or as a relative IRI minus the scheme and/or domain that is resolved relative to a base IRI.  If an [IRI](#iriDef) is deemed inappropriate for the resource a [blank node](#blankNodeDef) identifier may be assigned.  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) provides a special `@id` keyword for assigning identifiers to nodes.
    
In Caliper, the [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) `@id` keyword is aliased as `id` in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  This is done in order to avoid the temptation of employing [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) keywords as JSON object property names and is aligned with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) community practice.  Thus, each Caliper [Entity](#entity) described by the information model is provisioned with an `id` rather than `@id` property for identifying the resource.

Each [Event](#event) MUST be assigned an identifier in the form of a [UUID](#uuidDef) as a [URN](#urnDef) per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122) which describes a [URN](#urnDef) namespace for [UUIDs](#uuidDef).  Every [Entity](#entity) represented in the [Event](#event) MUST be assigned an `id` in the form of a valid [IRI](#iriDef) or a blank node identifier. The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be unique and persistent.  The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD be dereferenceable; i.e., capable of returning a representation of the [Entity](#entity).  A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided although care should be taken when employing a location-independent identifier since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it to retrieve machine-readable data.

#### Example: Event and Entity identifiers

```
{
  . . .
  "id": "urn:uuid:ff9ec22a-fc59-4ae1-ae8d-2c9463ee2f8f",
  "type": "NavigationEvent",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  . . .
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201701/courses/7/sections/1/pages/2",
    "type": "WebPage",
    . . .
  },
  . . .
}
```

<a name="jsonldTypes" />

### 3.3 Types and Type Coercion
[JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) employs the `@type` keyword in two ways.  Individual *nodes* (i.e., the thing being described) can be assigned a type.  Values can also be associated with or *coerced* to a particular type.  As with the aliasing of the `@id` keyword as `id`, `@type` is aliased as `type` in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) in keeping with [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) community practice.
  
The following [MessageEvent](#messageEvent) example utilizes an in-line context to illustrate how [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) types can be specified.  The [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [Person](#person) and [Message](#message) terms are all considered node types.  Other terms illustrate the *coercion* of values to specified data types.  In the example below, the values of the `actor`, `object` and `edApp` terms are *coerced* to the `@id` keyword.  This signals to a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) parser that if the value is set to a string (as is the case with `edApp`) it is to be interpreted as an [IRI](#iriDef).  In a like manner, the `action` value is *coerced* to the `@vocab` keyword indicating that the value is to be interpreted as a [Term](#termDef) defined in the active context or as an [IRI](#iriDef); in this case *Posted*.  Terms such as `name`, `description`, `dateCreated`, `dateModified` and `duration` are *coerced* to a particular value type such as a string, integer, boolean or date.

Both node types and typed values are specified in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  Implementors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the term definitions described therein.
 
#### Example: node and value types

```
{
  "@context": {
    "id": "@id",
    "type": "@type",
    "caliper": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/",

    "actor": {"@id": "caliper:actor", "@type": "@id"},
    "action": {"@id": "caliper:action", "@type": "@vocab"},
    "edApp": {"@id": "caliper:edApp", "@type": "@id"},

    "dateCreated": {"@id": "caliper:dateCreated", "@type": "xsd:dateTime"},
    "eventTime": {"@id": "caliper:eventTime", "@type": "xsd:dateTime"},
    "Posted": "verb:Posted"
  },
  "type": "MessageEvent",
  "id": "urn:uuid:0d015a85-abf5-49ee-abb1-46dbd57fe64e",
  "actor": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
    "type": "Person"
  },
  "action": "Posted",
  "object": {
    "id": "https://example.edu/sections/1/forums/2/topics/1/messages/2",
    "type": "Message",
    "body": "What does Caliper Event JSON-LD look like?",
    "dateCreated": "2017-12-15T10:15:00.000Z"
  },
  "eventTime": "2017-12-15T10:15:00.000Z",
  "edApp": "https://example.edu"
}
```

As noted above the values of certain Caliper [Terms](#termDef) are *coerced* to the `@id` keyword, which signals that string values are to be interpreted as [IRIs](#iriDef).  In other words, certain [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) attributes MAY be expressed either as a JSON object or as a string that corresponds to its identifier.  Type coercion of this sort provides an element of representational flexibility that implementors are encouraged to leverage.  As the abbreviated [ForumEvent](#forumEvent) example below demonstrates, in cases where an [Event](#event) references the same [Entity](#entity) more than once (e.g., `actor`, `member`, `user`; `group`, `organization`), or a property is associated with a specific type (e.g., `edApp`) or an [Entity](#entity) possesses an [IRI](#iriDef) that is dereferenceable, consider expressing the value as a string corresponding to the [Entity's](#entity) identifier.

#### Example: `membership` and `session` references to `actor` and `group` expressed as IRIs
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "id": "urn:uuid:a2f41f9c-d57d-4400-b3fe-716b9026334e",

Indeed, the example [ForumEvent](#forumEvent) could be thinned still further if each referenced [Entity](#entity) is provisioned with a dereferenceable [IRI](#iriDef) that permits consumers to retrieve a more robust representation of the object if required.

#### Example: Thinned ForumEvent comprised of (dereferenceable) IRI values
```
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",

}
```

Analytical consumers require accurate [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) context definitions to be capable of interpreting coerced values.  For Caliper defined [Terms](#terms) implementors need only reference the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) in their [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity) *describe* [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents in order to link to the associated term definitions.  A Caliper [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity) containing coerced values that do not map to an explicit context declaration will be considered nonconformant.

<a name="sensor" />

## 4.0 The Sensor API™
Caliper defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling and transmitting data to a target endpoints.  Adopting one or more [metric profiles](#metricProfiles) ensures adherence to the information model; implementing the [Sensor](#sensor) provides instrumented platforms, applications and services with a transport interface for communicating with data consumers.

<div style="design: block;margin: 0 auto"><img alt="Caliper Sensor" src="assets/caliper-sensor-v2.png"></div>

<a name="sensorBehavior" />

### 4.1 Behavior
A Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be capable of serializing and sending a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) containing the following payloads to one or more target [Endpoints](#endpoint).

* A JSON array consisting of one or more Caliper [Event](#event) documents, each expressed as JSON-LD.
* A JSON array consisting of one or more Caliper [Entity](#entity) "describe" documents, each expressed as JSON-LD.
* A JSON array consisting of a mix of one or more Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) describe documents, each expressed as JSON-LD.

A [Sensor](#sensor) MAY be assigned other responsibilities such as creating and validating Caliper entities and events but such capabilities need not be exposed to external data consumers.  

<a name="sensorEnvelope" />

### 4.2 Envelope
Caliper [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) data are transmitted inside an [Envelope](#envelope), a purpose-built JSON data structure that includes metadata about the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) and the data payload.  Each [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) "describe" included in an envelope's `data` array MUST be expressed as a [JSON-LD](#jsonld) document. 

#### Properties
Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) properties are listed below.  The `sensor`, `sendTime`, `dataVersion` and `data` properties are required.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  No custom properties are permitted.

| Property | Type | Description | Conformance |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| sensor | string | A unique identifier assigned either to the [Sensor](#sensor) or to the instrumented platform, application or service utilizing the [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be specified.  The identifier SHOULD be in the form of an [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| sendTime | DateTime | A date and time string value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates the time at which the [Sensor](#sensor) issued the message MUST be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Required |
| dataVersion | string | A string value indicating which version of the IMS Caliper Analytics® specification governs the form of the Caliper entities and events contained in the `data` payload MUST be specified. The value MUST be set to the IMS Caliper [Context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) [IRI](#iriDef) used to resolve the meanings of the `data` payload's terms and values. | Required |
| data | Array | An ordered collection of one or more Caliper [Entity](#entity) describes and/or [Event](#event) types.  The Sensor MAY mix describes and events in the same [Envelope](#envelope). | Required |

### 4.3 Transport

Business requirements informed by industry best practices will determine the choice of transport protocol for Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) and [Endpoint](#endpoint) implementors.  _Note that the IMS Caliper certification suite currently requires implementors seeking certification to send data to the certification test [Endpoint](#endpoint) using HTTPS with a bearer token credential consistent with [RFC 6750](#rfc6750)._  Where an alternate transport protocol is preferred for performance or other considerations, it is recommended to add that support in addition to HTTP transport for maximum interoperability.

Irrespective of the chosen transport protocol, each message sent by a [Sensor](#sensor) to a target [Endpoint](#endpoint) MUST consist of a single JSON representation of a Caliper [Envelope](#envelope). 

#### 4.3.1 HTTP Transport Requirements
 
* A [Sensor](#sensor) SHOULD be capable of communicating with a Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint) over HTTP with the connection encrypted by TLS or SSL.
* Messages MUST be sent using the POST request method.
* The following standard HTTP request headers MUST be set for use by the [Endpoint](#endpoint):
  * `Accept`
  * `Content-Type`
  * `Host`
* The `Content-Type` value MUST be set to the IANA media type "application/json".
* The following standard HTTP request headers SHOULD be set for use by the [Endpoint](#endpoint):
  * `Authorization`
  * `Content-Length`
* A [Sensor](#sensor) SHOULD support message authentication using the `Authorization` request header as described in [RFC 6750](#rfc6750), [Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2).  The `b64token` authorization credential sent by a [Sensor](#sensor) MUST be one the [Endpoint](#endpoint) can validate although the credential MAY be opaque to the emitting [Sensor](#sensor) itself. 
* The `Content-Length` of the request body MUST be measured in octets (8-bit bytes).


<a name="endpoint" />

## 5.0 Endpoint

A Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD be capable of communicating with a [Sensor](#sensor) via the conventional HTTP protocol using standard POST request method.  Caliper [Endpoints](#endpoint) MAY use other transport protocols to receive data from sensors.  See [Endpoints supporting non-HTTP protocols](#nonHttpEndpoint) for recommendations.

<a name="endpointStringLengths" />

### 5.1 Minimum Supported String Lengths
Certain Caliper data properties are expressed as strings of variable length.  [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) also defines a set of processing algorithms for transforming [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) documents in ways that can change the length of keys and values that are expressed as [IRIs](#iridDef), compact [IRIs](#iridDef) or [Terms](#termDef).  Many implementors will choose to store each incoming [Event](#event) and [Entity](#entity) *describe* received as a [JSON-LD](#jsonldDef) document or as a graph data structure consisting of nodes, edges and properties.  Others may opt to normalize or "flatten" some or all of the nested JSON objects that comprise a Caliper [Event](#event) or [Entity](#entity).  If the chosen persistence strategy involves normalizing Caliper semi-structured data, the following *minimum* character lengths SHOULD be adopted for the Caliper string properties listed below.

### 5.2 Endpoint Requirements

<a name="httpEndpoint" />

#### 5.2.1 HTTP Endpoint Requirements
* An [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD use HTTPS to secure the connection between the [Sensor](#sensor) and itself; if implemented a valid TLS/SSL Certificate MUST be provided.
* An [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) MUST be capable of accessing standard HTTP request headers.
* An [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD support message authentication using the `Authorization` request header as described in [RFC 6750](#rfc6750), [Section 2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2).

When communicating over HTTP an [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) MUST exhibit the following response behaviour:

* To signal to a [Sensor](#sensor) that it has successfully received an emitted [Envelope](#envelope) an [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) MUST reply with a `2xx` class status code. The [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD use the `200 OK` response but MAY instead choose to send a `201 Created` response (to indicate successful receipt of the message and creation of a new resource) or a `202 Accepted` response (to indicate successful acceptance of the message and queueing for further processing). The body of a successful response SHOULD be empty.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a malformed Caliper [Envelope](#envelope) (it does not contain `sensor`, `sendTime`, `dataVersion` and `data` properties of the required form), the [Endpoint](#endpoint) SHOULD reply with a `400 Bad Request` response.  Note that the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD NOT send a `400 Bad Request` response if the [Envelope](#envelope) contains a `dataVersion` value that the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) cannot support; in this case, the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD send a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response instead.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a message with a `Content-Type` other than "application/json", the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD reply with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.
* If the [Sensor](#sensor) sends a message without an `Authorization` request header of the RECOMMENDED form or sends a token credential that the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) is unable to either validate or determine has sufficient privileges to submit Caliper data, the [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) SHOULD reply with a `401 Unauthorized` response.
* The [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) MAY respond to [Sensor](#sensor) messages with other standard HTTP status codes to indicate result dispositions of varying kinds.  The [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) MAY also communicate more detailed information about problem states, using the standard method for reporting problem details described in [RFC 7807](#rfc7807).

Caliper [Endpoint](#httpEndpoint) implementers should bear in mind that some Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) implementations may lack sophisticated error handling.

<a name="nonHttpEndpoint" />

#### 5.2.2 Endpoints supporting non-HTTP protocols
Support for non-HTTP transport protocols involves a negotiation between the Caliper [Sensor](#sensor) and [Endpoint](#endpoint) implementations. It is RECOMMENDED that a Caliper [Endpoint](#endpoint) include support for communicating with Caliper [Sensors](#sensor) over HTTP to ensure maximum interoperability.

<a name="actions"/>
   
## Appendix A. Actions
Caliper includes a vocabulary of actions for describing learning interactions. Each action [Term](#termdef) is based on the past-tense form of an English (en-US) verb.  An action [Term](#termdef) can also indicate a change in a particular characteristic of the `object` (e.g., resolution, size, speed, volume).  Each action [Term](#termdef) is mapped to a persistent [IRI](#iriDef) listed in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  Each action is also linked to a brief definition ("gloss") derived in whole or in part from Princeton University's WordNet® project in order to eliminate ambiguity and aid natural language processing.
 
 Each Caliper [Event](#event) type supports one one or more of the actions listed below.  The [Event](#event) `action` property string value MUST be set to the appropriate [Term](#termDef). Only one action may be specified per [Event](#event).

## Appendix B. Events

<a name="event" />

### B.1 Event
A Caliper [Event](#event) is a generic type that describes a relationship established between an `actor` and an `object`, formed as a result of a purposeful [action](#actions) undertaken by the `actor` in connection to the `object` at a particular moment in time. The [Event](#event) properties `actor`, `action` and `object` form a compact data structure that resembles an [RDF](#rdf) triple linking a subject to an object via a predicate.

#### IRI
http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/Event

![Event Created image](assets/caliper-event_created-v2.png)

#### Properties
| Property | Type | Description | Conformance |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [UUID](#uuidDef) | The emitting application MUST provision the [Event](#event) with a [UUID](#uuidDef).  A version 4 [UUID](#uuidDef) SHOULD be generated.  The UUID MUST be expressed as a [URN](#urnDef) using the form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` per [RFC 4122](#rfc4122). | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Event](#event) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document MUST be specified.  For a generic [Event](#event) set the `type` to the string value *Event*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the `type` to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *NavigationEvent*. | Required |
| actor | [Agent](#agent) | The [Agent](#agent) who initiated the [Event](#event), typically a [Person](#person), [Organization](#organization) or [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication), MUST be specified.  The `actor` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the actor's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| action | [Term](#termDef) | The action or predicate that binds the actor or subject to the object MUST be specified.  The `action` range is limited to the set of [actions](#actions) described in this specification and may be further constrained by the chosen [Event](#event) type.  Only one `action` [Term](#termDef) may be specified per [Event](#event). | Required |
| object | [Entity](#entity) | The [Entity](#entity) that comprises the object of the interaction MUST be specified.  The `object` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the object's [IRI](#iriDef). | Required |
| eventTime | DateTime | A date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that indicates when the [Event](#event) occurred MUST be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Required |
| target | [Entity](#entity) | An [Entity](#entity) that represents a particular segment or location within the `object`.  The `target` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the target entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| generated | [Entity](#entity) | An [Entity](#entity) created or generated as a result of the interaction.  The `generated` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the generated entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| edApp | [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) | A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) that constitutes the application context MAY be specified.  The `edApp` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the edApp's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| referrer | [Entity](#entity)  | An [Entity](#entity) that represents the referring context MAY be specified. A [SoftwareApplication](#softwareApplication) or [DigitalResource](#digitalResource) will typically constitute the referring context.  The `referrer` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the referrer's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| group | [Organization](#organization) | An [Organization](#organization) that represents the group context MAY be specified.  The `group` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the group's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| membership | [Membership](#membership) | The relationship between the `actor` and the `group` in terms of roles assigned and current status MAY be specified.  The `membership` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the membership entity's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| session | [Session](#session) | The current user [Session](#session) MAY be specified.  The `session` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the session's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional | 
| federatedSession | [LtiSession](#ltiSession) | If the [Event](#event) occurs within the context of an [LTI](#lti) tool launch, the actor's tool consumer [LtiSession](#ltiSession) MAY be referenced.  The `federatedSession` value MUST be expressed either as an object or coerced to a string corresponding to the federatedSession's [IRI](#iriDef). | Optional |
| extensions | Array | An ordered collection of objects not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Event](#event). | Optional |

#### Subtypes
[AnnotationEvent](#annotationEvent), [AssignableEvent](#assignableEvent), [AssessmentEvent](#assessmentEvent), [AssessmentItemEvent](#assessmentItemEvent), [ForumEvent](#forumEvent), [MediaEvent](#mediaEvent), [MessageEvent](#messageEvent), [NavigationEvent](#navigationEvent), [OutcomeEvent](#outcomeEvent), [SessionEvent](#sessionEvent), [ToolUseEvent](#toolUseEvent), [ThreadEvent](#threadEvent), [ViewEvent](#viewEvent)

#### Deprecated subtypes
[ReadingEvent](#readingEvent)

#### Example
When representing the [Event](#event) as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/), a `@context` key MUST be embedded in the document with a value that references the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).

## Appendix C. Entities

<a name="entity" />

### C.1 Entity
A Caliper [Entity](#entity) is a generic type that represents objects or things that participate in learning-related activities.  [Entity](#entity) is subtyped for enhanced type specificity in order to better describe people, groups, digital content, courses, assignments, assessments, forums, messages, software applications and other entities that constitute the "stuff" of a Caliper [Event](#event).

Utilize [Entity](#entity) only if no suitable subtype exists to represent the thing being described.

#### IRI
http://purl.imsglobal.org/caliper/Entity

#### Properties
The base set of [Entity](#entity) properties is listed below.  Each property MUST be referenced only once.  The `id` and `type` properties are required; all other properties are optional.  Custom properties not described by the model MAY be included but MUST be added to the `extensions` property object array as values.  Properties with a value of *null* or empty SHOULD be excluded prior to serialization. 

| Property | Type | Description | Conformance |
| :------- | :--- | ----------- | :---------: |
| id | [IRI](#iriDef) | A valid [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be specified. The [IRI](#iriDef) MUST be unique and persistent. The [IRI](#iriDef) SHOULD also be dereferenceable, i.e., capable of returning a representation of the resource. A [URI](#uriDef) employing the [URN](#urnDef) scheme MAY be provided in cases where a [Linked Data](#linkedDataDef) friendly HTTP URI is either unavailable or inappropriate. | Required |
| type | [Term](#termDef) | A string value corresponding to the [Term](#termDef) defined for the [Entity](#entity) in the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1) document MUST be specified.  For a generic [Entity](#entity) set the `type` value to the term *Entity*.  If a subtype of [Entity](#entity) is created, set the type to the [Term](#termDef) corresponding to the subtype utilized, e.g., *Person*. | Required |
| name | string | A string value comprising a word or phrase by which the [Entity](#entity) is known MAY be specified. | Optional |
| description | string |  A string value comprising a brief, plain text representation of the [Entity](#entity) MAY be specified. | Optional |
| dateCreated | DateTime | A date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was created MAY be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Optional |
| dateModified | DateTime | A date and time value expressed with millisecond precision that describes when the [Entity](#entity) was last changed or modified MAY be specified.  The value MUST be expressed as an ISO-8601 formatted date/time string set to UTC. | Optional |
| extensions | Array | An ordered collection of objects not defined by the model MAY be specified for a more concise representation of the [Entity](#entity). | Optional |

#### Subtypes
[Agent](#agent), [Annotation](#annotation), [Assessment](#assessment), [AssessmentItem](#assessmentItem), [AssignableDigitalResource](#assignableDigitalResource), [Attempt](#attempt), [AudioObject](#audioObject), [BookmarkAnnotation](#bookmarkAnnotation), [Chapter](#chapter), [CourseOffering](#courseOffering), [CourseSection](#courseSection), [DigitalResource](#digitalResource), [DigitalResourceCollection](#digitalResourceCollection), [Document](#document), [FillinBlankResponse](#fillinBlankResponse), [Frame](#frame), [Forum](#forum), [Group](#group), [HighlightAnnotation](#highlightAnnotation), [ImageObject](#imageobject), [LearningObjective](#learningObjective), [LtiSession](#ltiSession), [MediaLocation](#mediaLocation), [MediaObject](#mediaobject), [Membership](#membership), [Message](#message), [MultipleChoiceResponse](#multipleChoiceResponse), [MultipleResponseResponse](#multipleResponseResponse), [Organization](#organization), [Page](#page), [Person](#person), [Response](#response), [Result](#result), [SelectTextResponse](#selectTextResponse), [Session](#session), [SharedAnnotation](#sharedAnnotation), [SoftwareApplication](#softwareapplication), [TagAnnotation](#tagAnnotation), [Thread](#thread), [TrueFalseResponse](#trueFalseResponse), [VideoObject](#videoobject), [WebPage](#webPage)

#### Deprecated subtypes
[EpubChapter](#epubChapter), [EpubPart](#epubPart), [EpubSubChapter](#epubSubChapter), [EpubVolume](#epubVolume), [Reading](#reading)

#### Example
When representing an [Entity](#entity) as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/), a `@context` key MUST be embedded in the document with a value that references the external IMS Caliper JSON-LD [context](http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1).  In cases where an Entity's local context duplicates the active context of an [Event](#event) of which it is a part, the Entity's `@context` property SHOULD be omitted.
